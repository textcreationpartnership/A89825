         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This therefore being a demonſtration for the ſtability and unmovable fixedneſs of the Earth in the middle of the World, of ſuch evident, obvious, and unrevincible experience as it is; Me thinks it cannot be ſufficiently wondred at, why the World ſhould ſeem ſo generally and ſo ſeriouſly to be taken with the Eccentrick and injudicious fancies of <hi>Coperni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> and <hi>Galilaeus,</hi> concerning the perpetual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which they imagine to be in the Earth, and that the Heavens or celeſtial Bodies ſtand ſtill
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170201:13"/>
and move not at all. Fancies, not only contrary to common ſenſe (ſo farre as ſenſe may be judge of the motion, reſt, diſtance, and ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Bodies, which certainly it may and ought to be in many caſes, and ſuch as doe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly pertain to this queſtion) contrary to the more generall and unanimous judgement of both ancient and modern Philoſophers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the evidence of ſo many thouſand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations Mathematicall and Aſtronomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, which have been founded and held good in all ages, upon the contrary ſuppoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Earth is the Center of the Univerſe; and that, <hi>ſecundum ſe totam,</hi> it never moveth; but contrary alſo unto Scripture, which refutes the opinion in a hundred places, reckoning the perpetuall motion of the Heavens, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable reſt and ſtability of the Earth, among the <hi>Magnalia Dei,</hi> or the chief works of Divine Providence and Wiſdome. The places are ſo obvious and frequent, that it ſeems ſcarce ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to alledge them; yet the reader, if he pleaſe, may ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.5, 6. and 104.19, 20. <hi>Joſ.</hi> 10.12, 13. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.9, 10, 11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.5. and 119.90. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.5. which laſt is the teſtimony of <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf, not only a great King, but as the Scriptures likewiſe teſtify of him 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.29, 30, 31, 32, 33. a great Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170201:13"/>
and one that underſtood the nature and conſtitution of the World better than any meere Philoſopher before him, or ſince; which I ſuppoſe no man will be ſo immodeſt as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. And though we acknowledge the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were not given principally to teach us a body of Naturall Philoſophy, as they frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tell us; yet doubtleſs they were given to teach us truth, in whatſoever they teach us, and how to judge of the works of God, eſpecially in thoſe great and more generall parts of the Creation, which, by their obviouſneſs and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, were to be the ſubject of every mans pious meditation and wonder: Neither can we but preſume, with ſome confidence, that the Author of Scripture underſtood the frame and conſtitution of his own handiwork ſomewhat better than <hi>Copernicus</hi> or <hi>Des Cartes;</hi> and would, without all doubt, have made another manner of report of it, if the truth had been otherwiſe, or that it had been his divine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that we ſhould have otherwiſe judged of it. Admit therefore, that the Scripture <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi> doth not ſpeak ſo exactly of the Natures of things, but <hi>more hominum,</hi> as they ſay, and by way of <hi>accomodation,</hi> or fitting it ſelf to the common judgment and apprehenſion of men, and conſequently that it ought not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170201:14"/>
in queſtions <hi>purely philoſophicall,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the evidence of naturall reaſon and demonſtration; yet certainly, where the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Scripture is ſo frequent and empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically aſſertive, as it is in many reſpects here, and when the ſtile thereof is not contrary unto, but conſonant to the generall properties and principles of Nature (by which even philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phically we are to judge, and in other caſes perpetually doe judge of Naturall things) if then we vouchſafe not both to ſpeak and think according to the language of Scripture, we ſeem to bear but little reſpect to Scripture; and though the <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>ſtile</hi> of a writing be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the one and ſame thing, yet in ſuch caſe it muſt not be every plauſible imagination or phantaſm that may poſſibly com in our mindes, but very neceſſary, cogent, and undeniable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration indeed, that ſhould induce us to dogmatize in any thing contrary to the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the ſacred ſtile. But who ever ſaw any thing alledged by the Carteſians of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? What neceſſary, cleer, and evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations doe they propound, either againſt the motion of the Heavens, or for the motion of the Earth? what objections doe they make, but learned men of the contrary opinion, doe as eaſily demonſtrate to be fallacious and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſticall,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170201:14"/>
and more eaſily anſwer than they ſeem to make them? Nay, for my part, 'tis more than I can yet obſerve, that they doe much pretend unto any ſuch matter, <hi>viz.</hi> as to demonſtrate either the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of their own ſyſtem of the World, or the <hi>impoſſibility</hi> and inconſiſtency of the Ptolemaick or common Syſtem, with the principles of Nature and Reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All that they labour about is rather to ſhew the poſſibility of their own deviſe, and to reconcile the <hi>Phoenomena</hi> or apparences of Heaven, and make them conſiſtent wirh the motion of the Earth: which though they were better able to doe, then I ſuppoſe they are, yet would it not follow, but that the other is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe as poſſible and conſiſtent; and having the advantage of divine teſtimony and atteſtation beſide, conſequently it would but little juſtify ſome of them to dogmatize ſo freely in the point as they doe, contrary to the ſtile of ſacred Scripture, and likewiſe to the judgement of ſome Eccleſiaſtical authority, that ought not to be ſlighted, before which <hi>Galilaeus</hi> himſelf was twice convinced of his error, and twice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canted his opinion. See <hi>Spondan. ad ann. Dom.</hi> 1633. <hi>ſect.</hi> 6.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I confeſs the opinion of ſome Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>viz. Carpenter</hi> in his Geographie, which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170201:15"/>
ſuſteineth onely the circular and diurnal moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Earth upon its own Axis and Center, is much leſs abſurd than that of <hi>Copernicus</hi> and his gang: for it ſuppoſeth onely one uniform moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that body; and if it could ſalve the <hi>Phoeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> aboveſaid &amp; there could be any ſufficient reaſon or cauſe aſſigned of ſuch motion ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or and prevalent, as it muſt be, unto that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reſiſtance which is in the body of the Earth, unto ſuch motion, as hath been ſaid, I ſhould readily enough aſſent to it; but am very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, neither the one nor the other can be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with truth. Whereas the opinion of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernicus,</hi> That the Sun is the Center of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; that it ſtandeth alwais ſtill; and that the Earth, like a Planet, moveth about him circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly betwixt the orbes, or Planetary circles of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> is lyable to infinite abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, contrary not only to the authority of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture, but of common ſenſe, common reaſon, and the naturall condition and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity of the Earth it ſelf. For firſt it maketh that Body, which of it ſelf is moſt unweldy, as I may ſay, and unapt for motion, and moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally diſpoſed to reſt, the ſubject of the moſt rapid and accelerated motion, which they will acknowledge in the whole Univerſe, and this without aſſigning any proportionate and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170201:15"/>
cauſe thereof. It is very well known, that one of the chiefeſt reaſons (I know not well whither I may not ſay <hi>the onely reaſon</hi>) w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they pretend againſt the motion of the Heavens is this, That the revolution of the ſuperior Orbes, eſpecially of the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> muſt neceſſarily be more ſwift than can be ſuppoſed in any naturall Body; which, though it ſeems a very childiſh and weak conceit, conſidering the nature of thoſe Bodies, and their aptitude to move; and likewiſe what power it is that firſt gave them, and ſtill continues the impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to it: yet againſt themſelves it concludes very well, <hi>viz.</hi> that they ought not to aſſigne the ſame motion (I mean in proportion <hi>the ſame</hi>) unto another Body in no proportion capable of it, at leaſt not without aſſigning a more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and evident cauſe of it than that of the Windes. But men are come to a great height of confidence in their aſſertions, it ſeems now adayes, and may well be pardoned ſuch a petty overſight as this, when they bluſh not to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain, deliberatly and ſoberly as a man would think, that the leaſt weight whatſoever, is able to overpoiſe the Earth, and that if but a Flie out of the aire lights upon it, the whole Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine or Body of it ſhuggs, as it were: I mean, that it is <hi>really moved therewith,</hi> and that ſome
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170201:16"/>
                        <hi>reall alteration</hi> is made in the ſite and poſition thereof, as to the other parts of the World. They that have the confidence to publiſh ſuch Theorems as theſe to the World, I confeſs, may be permitted to ſay, the Windes, or any thing elſe lighter than the winde, are a ſufficient cauſe, that the Earth circulates or turneth round once every day. Secondly, Becauſe it makes one and the ſame continuate Body ſubject to ſo many different and contrary motions, at the ſame time: As firſt a diurnal motion upon its own Axis. Secondly, an annual motion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it deſcribes and correſpondeth to the Signes of the Zodiack. And laſtly a motion, which they call, of Declination, quite contrary to that upon the Center, or the motion of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and whereby the whole Axis or Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Earth is made to be movable, and not fixed. Abſurdities, which in the motion of the Heavens, they know well enough, are eaſily ſalved by the ſuppoſition of Epicycles or leſſer Orbes moving within the compaſs of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: which being, as is ſuppoſed, diſcontinuate from the greater Orbe, under which they move, though carryed about with it by force of the diurnall revolution, yet may well be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to retain ſome peculiar motion of their own, different from that of the greater Orbe;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170201:16"/>
juſt as a Flie or a Snaile upon a wheel, may be ſuppoſed to be whirled about with the wheel from Eaſt to Weſt; and yet, at the ſame time, by a peculiar motion of its own, creep ſlowly on, quite contrary to the motion of the wheel, <hi>viz.</hi> from Weſt to Eaſt, or otherwiſe oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and traverſe the wheel, <hi>viz.</hi> from North to South. And being alſo neither concentrical with the ſuperior orbe, under which they move, nor with the Earth, but eccentricall and moving upon a different Axis and Center from them, it muſt needs follow, that the Planets or other Stars aſſigned to ſuch Orbs, and carried about by and with thoſe Orbs in a motion retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade and different from that of the ſuperior, ſhould at different times, that is, at different periods or points of their revolution, appear diverſly poſited, in reſpect of the Earth, and of us that live upon it; I mean ſometimes more diſtant and remote, ſometimes neerer at hand; ſomtimes more verticall, and ſomtimes more declining; according, I ſay, as the Planet or Star is carried either to his <hi>Augis</hi> or higheſt point of exaltation in the Epicycle; or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe to his <hi>Abſis,</hi> or depreſſion: and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And though the Carteſians reject theſe Epicycles never ſo much, as fictitiou and imaginary things, yet can it not be denyed, but that they are poſſible, and their ſuppoſition not contrary, but agreeable enough unto Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the quality of the Heavens. I ſay they are <hi>poſſible;</hi> which is more than can be ſaid of many of their ſuppoſitions. And whoſoever ſhall ſeriouſly conſider, in other parts of the Univerſe, how much it pleaſeth the Divine Wiſdome, by the contrarietie and inequality that is in particulars, to ballance, as it were, and bear up the generall Harmony, Equality, and Concord of the whole, may in time perhaps, come to think them neither ſo improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

For, (not to repeat any thing that hath been ſpoken already) what other reaſon can be given, why a man, ſtanding in any part of the Horizon, ſix of the Signes of the Zodiack will be ſeen of him, and the other ſix alwaies hid, but that the Earth is exactly, and at all times, in the mid'ſt of the World, or of the circumference of the Heavens? what reaſon can be given, why the Starrs appear alwaies of the ſame magnitude (if the aire be clear and equally diſpoſed at the times of obſervation) whether in the verticall point or at Eaſt, Weſt, or in whatſoever part of the Heavens they be obſerved, but that the parts of the Earth at all times keep the ſame diſtance from Heaven? what reaſon can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, why that whenſoever the two great Lights, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sun and Moon, are diametrally oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed one to another in the Heavens, that is, the one full North, the other full South, or the one full Eaſt, the other full Weſt, there alwaies happens an Eclypſe of the Moon? and why the Moon never happens to be Eclypſed, but when ſhe is ſo oppoſite to the Sun, but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Earth is perpetually in the midſt of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170201:18"/>
the World, and by conſequence in ſuch oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition neceſſarily prohibits and hinders the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion of the Suns-light upon the Moon? I have no intention to enter a controverſie with any man, much leſs to pretend an exact refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their opinion, how erroneous ſoever. What I have ſpoken hitherto hath been only <hi>obiter,</hi> and by way of preamble to the diſcourſe that followeth; wherein, being to treat of ſuch a conſiderable and rich part of the World as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica</hi> is, unknown to former ages, and to make report of ſome part of the great wealth and riches which divine Providence had, as it were, treaſured and laid up therein, to be diſpenſed unto other parts of the World in his appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time; I thought it not improper nor much amiſs, by way of Introduction, to take notice of a diſpute ſo neerly concerning the principall ſubject of my diſcourſ, which is the Earth, or habitable World, and to ſpeak my minde freely therein. How neceſſary is it, and how much could I wiſh, for the reſpects I bear to ſome Perſons in the world, that men profeſſing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and due reverence to the ſacred Writt, would oftentimes remember one excellent do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cument and adviſe therein, recorded by the Pen of that great Apoſtle and Doctor of the <hi>Gentils St. Paul,</hi> which is <hi>ſapere ad ſobrietatem,</hi> to uſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170201:18"/>
our Learning and all acquired Endowments ſoberly and with due reſpect unto the dictates of Religion; knowing this, that the minde of man is otherwiſe, of it ſelf, an abyſs of inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and irregular cogitations, to which, if we our ſelves ſet not bounds many times, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and voluntary acquieſcence in ſuch verities as divine Authority any way com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends unto us, but follow the ſwing of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall curioſity, and our fine pleaſing ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the utmoſt, we may in time come to diſpute our ſelves out of the right way, and be more apt to beleeve any thing, than what is good and true.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That which compleateth the Globe, and maketh the body of the Earth more entirely round, is the Element of Waters; which is a Subſtance compounded, as it were, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of Earth and Aire mixed together, yet in ſuch a proportion, as that the Subſtance of the Earth doth much predominate in the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. From hence it followeth, that the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Water muſt retain the naturall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of the Earth, which is, to <hi>move down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> in a direct line toward the Center of the World, as we ſee perpetually that it doth in every little drop of water, which divides the Aire, and makes it ſelf a direct paſſage through
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170201:19"/>
it towards the Earth and Center of the World; and likewiſe it muſt retain (though in a weaker and leſſer degree) the propertie of the Aire, which is to be diffufive and perpetually ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it ſelf, and unapt to be kept together but by ſome extrinſecal boundary or body that contains it. From the firſt of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the predominancy and propertie of the Earth in the Element of Water, it follows that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter muſt naturally cleave to the Earth, be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally united with it, and hardly, that is, not otherwiſe than by force ſeparated from it. So that there is no feare that the waters of the lower Hermi-ſphere, or of the Antipodes, ſhould fall back into the concave of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, as, upon our firſt thoughts of it, we are commonly apt to imagine; nor yet that any of the People or other living Creatures in that part of the World, ſhould have the like miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance. For, upon whatſoever part of the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies</hi> or Surface of the Earth they live and move, they are faſtened and glued, as I may ſay, to it by this natural &amp; inbred propertie of the Earth, which is predominant in their conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> to move downward, and incline to the Center, and which we ſee perpetually takes place in them, whenſoever their animal and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary motions ceaſe. From the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <pb n="19" facs="tcp:170201:19"/>
its natural fluxilitie and diffuſiveneſs it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that the water muſt be apt to inſinuate and lodg it ſelf in all ſuch cavities and recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles, whether upon the Surface or more within the bowels of the Earth, as the divine Providence hath prepared for it: and alſo that whereſoever it findeth a free paſſage, or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and that it is not ſtopt or kept in with banks or bounds, it ſhould be naturally and continually flowing or in motion, as the Aire is: And from both it appears, how apt the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it ſelf is to imbrace the Earth on all parts, and to conſtitute one common Globe or round Body with it. The Carteſians, men of ſuch diſcerning and ſearching capacities as they are, me thinks, if they would, might more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily finde ſome probable reaſon from hence, of that notable effect in Nature, which hath ſo long exerciſed their Speculations, <hi>viz.</hi> of the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, without being driven to a neceſſity of unſetling and ſhaking the foundation of all things, which the wiſdom of God hath ſo cleerely laid in and upon the Earth; and without perverting the glorious and never ſufficiently to be admired Syſtem and Frame of the World, with ſuch preſumption as they doe. Without doubt the influence of the celeſtial Bodies doe much concur to this
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170201:20"/>
effect, by their attenuating and rarefying the ſubſtance of that Element; and likewiſe the Windes, eſpecially thoſe which are natural and conſtant to the reſpective Climates of the World: Nor doe I think it an effect, that can be attributed unto any particular, uniform, or ſingle cauſe whatſoever; ſo as they that ſtretch their wits, and labor to attribute it to any ſuch cauſe, I fear labour in vain. But yet, under fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and with ſubmiſſion to better judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I ſuppoſe the principal and more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſe, which diſpoſeth the element of the Waters to ſuch an effect, may be that very thing or quality which we are now diſcourſing upon, <hi>viz.</hi> its natural fluxility and aptneſs to be perpetually running and in motion, where it hath a convenient channel wherein to flow, and wherby to empty it ſelf into another place. For, as we ſaid, naturally it is inconſiſtent in or with it ſelf alone; nor is there any other cauſe required to make it move or flow, but onely a way open and plain: So that if it were certain (as I think moſt Coſmographers hold it for very probable) that there were a channel at the North for the waters of <hi>Mare del Zur,</hi> or the weſtern Ocean, to paſs into the Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, as there is at the South for the waters of the Atlantick to paſs into <hi>Mare del Zur,</hi> I
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170201:20"/>
ſhould think without any more adoe, that what we call the Tyde, that is, the excreſcency of the waters in narrow Seas, Creeks and Rivers nigh the Sea (for in the main Ocean 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſaid there is little or noe Tyde obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) were nothing elſe but an effect of that great and general flood, by which the waters of one Hemiſphere doe continually flow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other, according to the courſe and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſuperior World, from which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide their natural proclivity and aptneſs unto motion they doe conſtantly receive an acceſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry influence and impreſſion to move; and which general flood, or courſe of the Waters out of one Hemiſphere into another, as it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth along the ſeveral coaſts of the World, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily putteth in aboundance of waters into all narrow Seas, Creeks, and other receptacles lying conveniently to receive it: and that the Ebbe is nothing elſe but the receſs of the ſame Waters, retiring and withdrawing themſelves (as they muſt neceſſarily doe) to follow the general flood, when it is gone by. But becauſe this paſſage or entercourſe of the Waters of the upper and lower Hemiſphere, by the North, is not to me ſo evident, I leave the whole matter as a Problem, and Subject of further meditation to thoſe that are willing to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170201:21"/>
think upon and ſtudy the great works of divine Providence with modeſty and religious ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: not doubting, but that ſufficient reaſon may be found otherwiſe of this admirable effect, from the natural property and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Water (as hath been ſaid) to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies moving and flowing one way or other; from its aptitude likewiſe to receive impulſion, or an impreſſion to move from all other things; from the natural ſite and poſition of the parts of the Earth, in the ſeveral quarters of the World, by which it floweth; and from diverſe other cauſes, that poſſibly might be obſerved, if we did apply our ſelves to take notice of them as we ought.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The general Globe, or whole body of the Earths circumference, is divided by the Equinoctial line, into two great and equall Hemiſpheres, or half parts, which they call the upper and lower Hemiſphere; and ſometimes the Northern and Southern, becauſe they lie upon the North and South ſide of the line that runneth betwixt them and divides them one from another: And by the Meridian (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly caled the Meridian of the World) into two other, which they call the Eaſtern and the Weſtern for the ſame reaſon. It containeth four general quarters, or known habitable

thoſe Parts and ſuch other Nations of the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as have left us any reports, or hiſtory of former times, that knowledg was long ſince ſo utterly extinct and forgotten, as if it had never been. As for the Text of Scripture, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3 6. which is ſometimes alledged, where the Gold, which King <hi>Solomon</hi> uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Temple, is ſaid to be <hi>Gold of Parvaim,</hi> and which the favourers of the affirmative opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, interpret of the Country of <hi>Peru</hi> in <hi>America:</hi> though ſome learned men inſiſt upon it, yet to others it ſeems rather a plauſible conjecture, than a good argument; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever conſiders how unlikely it is, that a Country once famouſly known and ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon ſuch an occaſion, ſhould ever come to be unknown, and, as it were, loſt in the world: or that Commerce and Traffique, once held and ſetled between Nations, upon a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity ſo much eſteemed and deſired by all men, as gold is, ſhould ever come to be totally diſcontinued with all Nations, and to ſuffer a lapſe beyond all memory of men and ages; I ſay, whoſoever conſiders this, I think in reaſon he ſhould acknowledge, that the negative opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is more probable; and that we doe but right to the memorie of <hi>Columbus,</hi> and thoſe other brave men, his followers, ſtill to account

them the firſt diſcoverers of this <hi>new World,</hi> as 'tis commonly called; and in that quality to ſpeak a few words of them, before we proceed any further.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſtopher Columbus</hi> was by Nation an Italian, born, as it is ſaid, at <hi>Nervi</hi> in the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the Common-wealth of <hi>Genoa;</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by his education and long practiſe at Sea, attained to a great skill in the Art of Navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in all Maritim affairs, was at this time become famous and well accepted, by reaſon of his good abilities, to moſt of the Princes of Chriſtendome; being well known in the Courts of <hi>England, Spain, Portugall,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and being alſo a good Mathematician, by obſerving the daily courſe of the Sunne, came at laſt to a reſolution with himſelf, that there muſt needs be yet ſome other World, unknown to us, to whom that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Planet diſpenſed the benefit of his raies, during his abſence from our Hemiſpheare: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likewiſe ſurpriſed with an intenſe deſire of diſcovering that preſumed World, and of ſearching out where it lay, and what kinde of People it had. The French are not willing that the glorie of this enterpriſe ſhould be ſo intirely attributed to <hi>Columbus; Thuanus,</hi> a grave &amp; good Author poſitively affirming, that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170201:23"/>
                        <hi>Mounſieur Betoncourt,</hi> a French-man, who firſt diſcovered the <hi>Azores</hi> or <hi>Tercerae</hi> Iſlands, as they call them, and afterwards ſold them to the Spaniards, gave him ſome information of the Country, and did little leſs than put him upon the deſigne. Others ſpeak of a certain Pilot, who had been wrackt upon ſome of the very Coaſts of <hi>America,</hi> with whom <hi>Columbus</hi> had the good fortune to be acquainted, and to learn much from him: That <hi>Martin Vincent,</hi> his Brother in Law by the marriage of his Wifes Siſter (being himſelf alſo a man much uſed to the Sea) had aſſured him, that he was once by a ſtorm, carried more then 450 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees weſtward of the Cape of <hi>St. Vincent</hi> upon the Coaſt of <hi>Africk,</hi> and that he there met with certain great loggs or pieces of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber floating upon the Sea, ſuch as he could not but beleeve were driven thither from ſome weſtern Country or Iſlands, lying further into the Main. That the Inhabitants of the <hi>Azores</hi> or <hi>Tercerae</hi> Iſlands, had told him, that upon the Coaſts of <hi>Gracyoſa, Fayal,</hi> and <hi>Flores</hi> Iſlands, there had been lately caſt certain Pine trees of <hi>India,</hi> and certain dead men, of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and ſtature much differing from the proportion of any other known Nations; and likewiſe certain weather-driven Canoes or
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170201:23"/>
little Boats, which they knew were uſed by none but Indians, or by ſome other unknown remote Nations, which muſt lye weſtward of them. All which, whether it were true or falſe, matters not much: For whatſoever the firſt inducements and encouragements were, which <hi>Columbus</hi> had towards the enterpriſe, 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, he was the firſt that propounded it to the Chriſtian World, and proſecuted his propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with ſuch a conſtancy and magnanimous reſolution, notwithſtanding the many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and oppoſitions which for a long time he met with, as may eaſily argue ſomthing more than the hand or counſel of man in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, both ſupporting and conducting him in it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For not being able out of his private for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes to furniſh himſelf out upon ſuch a deſign, he was forced to have recourſe to certain Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes and States, and to deſire their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: ſome of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> rejected his propoſitions as ridiculous and vain; to wit, the State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> to whom, as being his native Country, he firſt applyed himſelf. In the Court of <hi>Portugall,</hi> where he had married a wife, and by that means was become free Denizen and a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of that Crown, he was maligned and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of his purpoſe out of envy, by ſome of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170201:24"/>
the Councell very powerfull with that King: who although they would not ſeem to regard his propoſition, yet privately &amp; under pretence of a voyage onely to <hi>Cape Verde,</hi> themſelves ſent out a Carvell, with inſtructions to make what diſcoveries they could of any Land weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. But their project had no great ſucceſs; the Carvell after much fowl weather and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip endured, making a difficult return home, and diſcovering nothing. Whereupon he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth himſelf to the King of <hi>England,</hi> who was at that time <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, a Prince that loved treaſure well enough, but cared not to hazard much to gain it: and all that <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus</hi> could promiſe as yet upon that point was onely, that he would diſcover a ſhorter way to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> whereby Chriſtian Princes might procure themſelves the wealth of thoſe rich Countries already known, in a ſhorter time, and at far leſs charges than hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto they had been able to doe. But what through the parcimony of this Prince, and his cold attention to the buſineſs when it was firſt propounded to him; and what through the misfortunes which his Brother <hi>Bartholmew Columbus,</hi> met withall in his way to <hi>England,</hi> which ſomewhat hindred his addreſſes to the King, there was no anſwer given, till it was too
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170201:24"/>
late, and that <hi>Columbus</hi> had engaged his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice unto <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile;</hi> who at laſt, <hi>viz.</hi> after a matter of ſix or ſeven years attendance and delayes, had yeilded to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, at the earneſt entreaty of the Queen <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and of the Cardinal <hi>Mendoza</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Toledo.</hi> It is ſaid, that the Queen was become ſo zealous and earneſtly affected to the buſineſs, as 'tis ſuppoſed, upon ſome principles of Religion, ſuggeſted to her by a Religious man, <hi>Fernando de Talovera</hi> her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, that ſhe pawned many of hir own Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els to help to furniſh him out: and 'tis certain, the Treaſure of <hi>Caſtile</hi> was never more exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, than it was at that time, through a long and chargeable warre with the Moors, which was not quite ended when <hi>Columbus</hi> received his Commiſſion: So that many humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons might ſeem to have excuſed that King from undertaking any new charge, at that time eſpecially, had it not been the will of divine Providence to have that work goe forward, and to recompenſe the liberality and piety of thoſe Princes with ſuch an infinite advantage both of wealth and honour, by the means of this man.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. On Friday the third of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1492, he ſet out from <hi>Palos,</hi> a Port Town of <hi>Andaluſia,</hi>
                        <pb n="30" facs="tcp:170201:25"/>
with three Carvels, whereof the Admirall <hi>Sancta Maria,</hi> was commanded by himſelf; the Vice-Admirall <hi>Pinta,</hi> commanded by Captain <hi>Martin Pincon;</hi> and the <hi>Ninna,</hi> commanded by Captain <hi>Vincent Yannez, Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eon,</hi> having aboard in all of them together about 120 men, and among them <hi>Americus Veſpucius</hi> for one. On the eleventh of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> following they had ſight of the <hi>Canary</hi> Iſlands, and ſailing forwards, on the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day they met with certain quantities of long graſs floating upon the water, and upon one of them a Graſ-hopper alive; which graſs, as it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed daily more and more for ſome time, ſo it put them in continual hopes every day of coming to ſome Land. Nevertheleſs they ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Auguſt</hi> quite out, the whole Moneth of <hi>September</hi> following, and ſome part of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> without kenning of any land; which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled them extreamly; inſomuch that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany began to mutiny deſperately, and to threaten their Admiral, that they would throw him overboard, unleſs he would preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for <hi>Spain;</hi> ſwearing <hi>they were abus'd,</hi> and <hi>that he ſhould not make himſelf a great Lord, as he intended, with the perill of their lives.</hi> They alledged moreover, that the Ships were ſpent and grown ſo leaky, that they thought they
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170201:25"/>
would ſcarce endure the Seas ſo long, as to carry them ſafely home again. <hi>Columbus</hi> was much afflicted with this behaviour and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Souldiers, yet endeavored to pacify and draw them on, as much as he could, with good words, and to animate them ſtill with hopes of ſucceſs: but at length, ſeeing nothing elſe could prevail with them, much againſt his will, he made them a promiſe, that if within three dayes they deſcryed not Land, he would forthwith return for <hi>Spain.</hi> This was on the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October;</hi> and the very night following they diſcovered the Iſland <hi>Guanahani,</hi> one of the <hi>Leucaiae</hi> Iſlands, which lye together in the Gulfe of <hi>America,</hi> called afterwards by <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus St. Salvador.</hi> This was a great rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to them all, eſpecially to <hi>Columbus,</hi> who went on ſhore; and having ſung the <hi>Te Deum</hi> on his knees, with tears in his eyes, he erected a Croſs and took poſſeſſion of the Iſland in the name of the Catholique Kings <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabella,</hi> all the Spaniards that were with him preſently (according to his Patent) acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging him Viceroy of the Countrie. There were ſtanding by ſome few of the Natives, wondring to ſee men cloathed and ſo acoutred as the Spaniards were, themſelves being for the moſt part naked, and onely painted upon their

bodies, with white, black, red, and other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours as their fancie lead them. In their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils and upon their lips ſome of them had rings of gold pendant, as it were, in the way of ornament; which the Spaniards quickly eſpied: and inquiring of them by ſignes, where they had ſuch fine things, they came to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that a certain King of that Country, who lived a great way further toward the South, had aboundance of it. This news pleaſed them ſo well, that they made no long ſtay there, but on the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> they ſet Sail, and fell upon another of thoſe Iſlands ſeven or eight leagues diſtant from this, which they called <hi>la Conception;</hi> from thence upon the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> they came to the Iſland <hi>Fernandina;</hi> and from thence to <hi>Cuba: Columbus</hi> not ſuffering his men in any of theſe places, to take ought from the Natives againſt their will, or without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them ſomething for it, which they ſeemed to deſire. At <hi>Cuba</hi> he found that the Natives had ſome Towns and Villages, which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, and were ſo ordered, that in fifty or threeſcore houſes ſometimes 2000 or 1500 people of Men, Women, and Children, were contained, according to the cuſtome of the Country, that all People of the ſame Linage or Kindred lived together in one houſe: and their

From hence they ſailed to <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> where they had ſight of the King of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, named <hi>Guacanagari,</hi> who received him and his company with much ſhew of kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, preſenting him with the Fruits and other Commodities of the Country; and, which was better than all the reſt, giving them more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain information of thoſe golden Provinces, which were afterwards diſcovered in the main Land; for as yet they were but upon Iſlands, and had not touched or ſeen any part of the Continent of <hi>America. Columbus</hi> was ſo well ſatisfied with the intelligence which he had gained, that he reſolved to return for <hi>Spain,</hi> and to make report of his Adventures to the King; whereunto the condition of his Ships, want of ſome neceſſary Proviſions to proceed further, together with ſome other accidents, did alſo induce him. For, as it commonly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in the affairs of this World, unanimity and friendſhip laſteth not long among men, eſpecially where ſelf-love and private intereſt once make a breach, his Vice-Admiral <hi>Pincon,</hi> perceiving the voyage likely to be profitable,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170201:27"/>
had by this time ſeparated himſelf from <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus,</hi> upon pretence of ſome offence taken, but really out of hopes to advance his Fortunes better by going apart by himſelf; which, though it were derogatorie to his Commiſſion and the command which he had over him, as Admirall, yet <hi>Columbus</hi> was content to beare with it, for the better carrying on of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon deſign; ſo they were reconciled: And having built the Fort of <hi>Natividad</hi> in <hi>Hiſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niola,</hi> for the guard of ſome Spaniards that were to be left there, <hi>Columbus</hi> ſet ſail for <hi>Spain</hi> on Friday the fourth of <hi>January,</hi> having firſt charged his men to ſhew all due reſpect to the King of the Country, and not to wrong the Natives. But how they did obſerve his charge, doth not ſo well appear; For the men are ſaid to be murder'd, all of them, by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, during the abſence of <hi>Columbus:</hi> and this is thought to have been ſome occaſion, not onely of the Warre, which the Spaniards made afterwards upon the Natives, but of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive ſeverity and cruelty, which for a long time together they uſed towards them. In his return he diſcovered a great part more of the coaſts of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> and gave names to diverſe Capes and Harbors, by which he paſſed: But drawing neer home, he ſuffered two ſuch ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170201:27"/>
ſtorms, upon the coaſts of <hi>Spain,</hi> as had well nigh buried him and all his hopes in the bottome of the Sea. By reaſon whereof, and for the performance of ſome vows, which he had made in his diſtreſs, he went on Land, upon ſome part of the Kingdom of <hi>Portugall;</hi> which he thought he might ſafely doe: But it proved otherwiſe. For the fame of his voyage being blown home before him, there was in the Court of <hi>Portugall</hi> no little matter of offence conceived againſt him, That he, being a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of that Crown (as we have ſaid he was by the right of his Wife) ſhould doe ſuch an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſervice, without leave, to a forraign Prince, and one that perhaps, was little better than an Enemy. This was chiefly through the inſtigation of ſome malevolent perſons about the King: and although the ſuggeſtion were altogether injurious and groundleſs, <hi>Columbus</hi> having firſt offered his ſervice to that King, and been refuſed, yet it prevailed ſo farre, that <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus</hi> was apprehended and ſent up to <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon.</hi> But the King himſelf ſeeing him, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the expectation and endeavours of ſome about him, uſed him with much reſpect and kindneſs; and after ſome ſhort time, having had that diſcourſe with him, concerning his voyage and adventures, that he deſired, he let
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170201:28"/>
him freely paſs to the Court of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> Where he was received with a welcome anſwerable to the ſucceſs of his endeavours, and to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage which they promiſed that Crown; and quickly furniſhed out again with more and better Ships, wherein he made ſeveral and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfull voyages, ſtill diſcovering more and more of this new World which he had found, and aſſerting the ſeveral Provinces where he came, to the Crown of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> And although towards his latter end, through the procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome enemies which he had at Court, whoſe envy, like a dark ſhadow, perpetually attended the luſtre of his brave actions, he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſome Eclypſe for a time in his honour and reputation, upon occaſion of a Rebellion, which one <hi>Roldanio Ximenez,</hi> a ſeditious tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent fellow, and one that had been once his Servant, and advanced by him, had begun to raiſe in the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> and that <hi>Bobadilla</hi> was ſent to be Governor of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> in his ſtead: yet being come to Court, though in quality of a Priſoner, and, as ſome ſay, in chains, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance and ſenſe of his former merits, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his own approved honeſtie and vertue, ſoon diſſipated thoſe clowds of jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and ſuſpicion, which were gathered againſt him; and the Catholique Kings look'd favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170201:28"/>
upon him, renewed and confirmed his former Authority and priviledges, <hi>viz.</hi> of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall of thoſe Weſtern Seas, (which Office his Sonne and Nephew after him a long time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed) created him Duke <hi>De la vega</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> being a Town which himſelf had built: So that he both lived and dyed with Honor; being a man, as 'tis credibly reported of him by diverſe Authors, of exemplary Piety and Vertue; very religious and devout to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God; juſt, affable, and courteous to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Men; temperate and abſtenious in all things; and in a word, ſuch a man (as Mr. <hi>Purchas</hi> truly acknowledgeth of him) as <hi>God had made a fit inſtrument for ſo great a work, viz.</hi> as was the diſcovery of ſo many great, rich, fertil, and fair Countries, as were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unknown to the Chriſtian World; being no leſs celebrated by the Spaniſh Writers, <hi>Oviedo, Herrera,</hi> and others, for his magnanimity, courage, wiſdome, and admirable reſolution in his undertakings.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Second to <hi>Columbus,</hi> in the glorie of this grand and ſucceſsfull enterpriſe of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the new World, was <hi>Americus Veſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> a Florentine; who eſpecially in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice at the charge of <hi>Emanuell,</hi> King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall,</hi> undertook the buſineſs. He had been
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170201:29"/>
one of <hi>Columbus</hi> his companions in the firſt expedition, and conſequently did now but trace the way which <hi>Columbus</hi> had before ſhewed him; yet had he this happineſs and honour above his Predeceſſor, <hi>viz.</hi> to give name unto the Country diſcovered; the whole Continent of the new World being ever ſince generally called <hi>America</hi> from him. This man, as was ſaid, having made ſeveral voyages to <hi>America,</hi> partly with <hi>Columbus,</hi> and partly by himſelf, in the ſervice of King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and by them diſcovered much of the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of <hi>America</hi> on this ſide the Equator, in the year 1502 <hi>Emanuell,</hi> King of <hi>Portugall,</hi> took him into his ſervice. Under whom ſeting out of <hi>Liſbon</hi> with his companions, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent number of Ships, they ſailed up to the Equator; and having croſſed the line, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the coaſts of <hi>Guiana</hi> and <hi>Braſil,</hi> beyond the Tropique of <hi>Capicorne</hi> to 32 degrees of Southern latitude; where having ſtayed ſome time, and taken poſſeſſion of the Country af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their uſual formalities, they held on their courſe beyond the River of <hi>Plate,</hi> unto 52 degrees, as <hi>Munſter</hi> in his Coſmographie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth; which is accounted to be full the height of the Streites. But here being taken w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> foul weather, and their Ships much ſpent and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170201:29"/>
impaired by the ſtormes, they were forced to retun homeward by the coaſt of <hi>Afrique.</hi> In the year following, <hi>viz.</hi> 1503, he attempted another voyage, directing his courſe for <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi> or <hi>Inſula Real,</hi> in the Country of <hi>Braſil;</hi> but having paſſed <hi>Cape Verde</hi> and <hi>Sierra Liona,</hi> upon the coaſt of <hi>Guinee,</hi> by a great misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, the Ship which carried their chief Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions was ſunk, and 300 Barrels or Hogſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads of Victuals and other neceſſary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for the company, was utterly loſt: by which diſaſter being forced again to turn homeward, how long he lived, or what expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions he made after this, it doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. I ought not altogether to forget Sir <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian Cabot,</hi> a Venetian Gentleman, yet born and living in <hi>England;</hi> who likewiſe about this time, <hi>viz.</hi> in the year 1496, at the charge of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, King of <hi>England,</hi> ſet out with two Carvels, for the diſcovery of a North-weſt paſſage to <hi>Cathay</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> according to the deſign which <hi>Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> had firſt ſuggeſted to him. In purſuit whereof, he is reported to have ſailed to 67 degrees of Northern latitude upon the coaſt of <hi>America;</hi> but finding the Land ſtill to bear Eaſtward, which was contrarie to his purpoſe,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170201:30"/>
he turned ſail and coaſted down Southward as farre as <hi>Florida,</hi> where with the uſual cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, he took poſſeſſion of ſeveral places, in the name of the King of <hi>England,</hi> as we ſhall further ſee in the particular deſcription of the Continent. In the way he diſcovered the Iſlands <hi>Baccaleos,</hi> or of Cod-fiſh; ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from the great aboundance of that kinde of Fiſh which they met withall upon the coaſts. They lie 25 leagues into the Sea over againſt <hi>Cape Raye</hi> of New-found land; where the Engliſh have an extraordinary good Trade for Fiſhing, and alſo many other rich Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But being forced at length to return home again for want of Victuals, his buſineſs, by reaſon of Warres which we had then with <hi>Scotland,</hi> was wholly laid aſide, to the great prejudice of the Engliſh Nation, who in all probability might have made themſelves quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Maſters at leaſt with the Spaniard in the wealthieſt parts and Provinces of <hi>America,</hi> if the buſineſs had been well followed. Sir <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian</hi> himſelf went immediatly thereupon into <hi>Spain:</hi> and though he returned again into <hi>England,</hi> and was graced by the King with ſome titulary dignity, <hi>viz.</hi> of Grand Pilot of <hi>England,</hi> and a penſion; yet ſeeing his deſign was never revived to effect, I ſhall forbear to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170201:30"/>
ſpeak further of him: as likewiſe I ſhall doe concerning <hi>Ferdinand Magellan</hi> a Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheſe; whoſe name, although it be deſervedly famous in the Hiſtory and affairs of the new World, and that he had the happineſs to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what ſo many before him had ſought, but could not finde, namely a paſſage to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> by the South Sea and the coaſt of <hi>America,</hi> called therefore from him ever ſince <hi>Megellans Streits:</hi> yet becauſe his buſineſs chiefly was to diſcover, and not to conquer; and that his deſign upon the Continent failed, which was to have planted a Colonie of Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards in the middle and narroweſt part of the Streits, thereby to have ſecured the Streits to himſelfe, and prohibited the paſſage to all Strangers, it may ſuffice to remember him in ſome other place, that is, in the deſcription of that part of the Continent which lyeth upon thoſe Streits.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the Voyage to <hi>America;</hi> or the ordinary courſe of Navigation, which the Spaniards commonly hold, to and from the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THe Engliſh Nation have long ſince bin acquainted with the waies to the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> reaſonably well, as appears by the many brave exploits gallantly attempted, and no leſs ſtoutly and ſucceſsfully performed by them in thoſe parts, both at Sea and Land; ſome of which I ſhall not altogether forget to mention in due place. So that this Chapter may ſeem not ſo neceſſarie. Nevertheleſs for the ſatisfaction of thoſe, who are never likely to ſee <hi>America</hi> otherwiſe then in a Map; nor to underſtand the affairs of that rich part of the World, but by ſuch reports and relations as this, I think it not altogether inconvenient to ſpeak a few words of the particular voyage, or courſe held by Sea, to and from <hi>America,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Spaniards commonly <hi>Carrera de las Indias.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Their courſe is wholly Weſtward; and they reckon commonly from <hi>Sevill</hi> in <hi>Andalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zia,</hi>
                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:170201:31"/>
which is a Province of old <hi>Spain</hi> to St. <hi>John D' vllua,</hi> a famous and much fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented Port of the Province of <hi>New-Spain</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> about 1700 leagues, after the Spaniſh meaſure, which is thrice ſo much of Italian or common miles; and with favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable windes they doe ordinarily diſpatch it in two moneths and an half. To <hi>Nombre be bios,</hi> or <hi>Porto-bello,</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> they reckon 1400 leagues, and doe uſually make their voyage in two moneths. They ſet out commonly from <hi>St. Lucar,</hi> which is the Port, as it were, to <hi>Sevill;</hi> or elſe from <hi>Palos,</hi> a Sea Town in the ſame Province with <hi>Sevill,</hi> &amp; not many miles diſtant from St. <hi>Lucar,</hi> Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and hold their courſe directly for the <hi>Canaries,</hi> which are certain Iſlands towards the coaſts of <hi>Africk,</hi> under the dominion of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> well known for the rich Wines yearly tranſported thence. They lye about 200 leagues diſtant from <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Ships arrive at them commonly in eight or ten daies, if nothing hinder, making their courſe through the Bay or Gulf <hi>De las yeguas,</hi> as they call it, from the aboundance of Mares which they were tranſporting into <hi>America,</hi> and were forced thereabouts, by a ſtorm, to caſt over board. It is counted the moſt difficult
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170201:32"/>
paſſage betwixt <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> eſpecially in the Winter-time, being then for the moſt part dangerouſly infeſted with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and contrary windes. At theſe Iſlands the Spaniards ordinarily victuall and ſupply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with neceſſaries, the Countrie being rich and affording all things requiſite for their journey plentifully, eſpecially that called <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> where they uſe moſt commonly to touch and furniſh themſelves. From hence they ſet ſail for <hi>America,</hi> by the Iſlands of <hi>Cape Verde,</hi> which lye in the Atlantick Ocean, a few de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees within the Tropiques, toward the coaſt of <hi>Africk:</hi> And hither, for the moſt part, they have an eaſie and certain courſe, ſeldom wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome favorable winde or other to bring them within the Tropiques, or Torrid Zone, as 'tis commonly called: and being there, they have conſtant windes forward, which they call <hi>The Briſes</hi> or Levant-windes. Theſe are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Eaſterly windes, which continually blow within the Tropiques, on both ſides of the Equator, never failing; and in the ſpace of fourteen or fifteen daies, doe carry the Ships within ſight of the Northern Iſlands, as they at the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> call them; which are, as it were the Suburbs of the New World, lying thick ſcattered upon the coaſt of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170201:32"/>
                        <hi>America,</hi> in the Atlantick or North Sea.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The firſt which they commonly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, are ſome of the <hi>Caribee</hi> Ilands, lying to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the coaſt of <hi>Paria, viz. Deſſeada, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica, Guadalupe;</hi> at which laſt they alwaies come to Anchor, and refreſh themſelves both going and coming; and from hence diſperſe themſelves to the ſeveral parts and Ports of <hi>America,</hi> for which they are bound. Thoſe that goe for <hi>New-Spain,</hi> take the right hand way towards the Iſland <hi>Hiſpaniola;</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſcovered the Cape <hi>St. Anthony,</hi> which is a foreland or Promontorie, in the furtheſt and moſt Weſterly parts of <hi>Cuba,</hi> they ſail in ſight of the Iſlands both of <hi>St. John de Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rico,</hi> and alſo of <hi>Hiſpaniola;</hi> of which laſt they leave the Port or Citty of St. <hi>Domingo</hi> at a diſtance of two or three leagues off at Sea, and hold their courſe betwixt the Iſlands of <hi>Cuba</hi> and <hi>Jamaica,</hi> till they attain St. <hi>John D' ullua,</hi> or <hi>Vera Crux,</hi> in the Province of <hi>New Spain.</hi> This paſſage, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Iſlands <hi>Deſſeada</hi> and <hi>Guadalupe,</hi> to <hi>St. John D'ullua</hi> is reckoned to be little leſs than 500 leagues; and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſo many Iſlands, great and ſmall, which lie in their way, and cauſe the Seas to be much ſubject to contrary windes, it is counted a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of no little difficultie, and not to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temped,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170201:33"/>
as <hi>Herrera</hi> ſaith, without a very skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Pilot, and that in the day time, with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of a good winde and a full Sea; in reſpect whereof they commonly make it twenty daies paſſage, and are glad if they can reach it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that time. Thoſe that goe for the Main Land, as they call it, or <hi>Caſtella del oro,</hi> have a paſſage of 400 leagues from <hi>Guadalupe</hi> above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. Theſe take the left-hand way; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſcovered the high Mountain of <hi>Tayrone,</hi> which is as a <hi>Pharos</hi> or generall Land-mark for ſuch as ſail upon that coaſt: they touch at <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagena,</hi> a famous and well-ſeated Port and Citty of that Province; and from thence paſs on to <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> or <hi>Porto-Bello,</hi> from which places they convey all their Merchandiſe by Land unto <hi>Panama,</hi> which is not above eighteen or twenty miles diſtant, and lyeth upon the South Sea: where they are Shipt again; and from thence by Sea conveyed to all the parts of the Province of <hi>Peru.</hi> They that goe to <hi>Honduras</hi> and the Province of <hi>Guati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mala,</hi> keep company with them that goe for <hi>New-Spain,</hi> till they diſcover Cape <hi>Tiburon,</hi> which is the firſt point of <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> Weſtward, where they leave them, and run along upon the North-ſide of the Iſland <hi>Jamaica,</hi> unto the point of <hi>Negrillo:</hi> Then they put to Sea, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170201:33"/>
ſeek the Cape called <hi>Cameron,</hi> which is at the entrance of the gulf and Province of <hi>Honduras;</hi> from whence ſailing fourteen or fifteen leagues Weſtward, they come to Anchor at <hi>Truxillo,</hi> upon the River <hi>Haguara,</hi> which run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the ſaid Gulf, and unlade their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe, ſo much of it as is intended for thoſe parts: the reſt they carry further up the Gulf to <hi>Porto de Cavallos,</hi> or <hi>St. Thomas de Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile;</hi> and from thence along the coaſt into the Province of <hi>Guatimala.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. The beſt and moſt uſual time for an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward voyage, that is from <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>America,</hi> is about the Spring, <hi>viz.</hi> from the latter end of <hi>March</hi> to the beginning of <hi>May;</hi> for then commonly they make their voyage in due time, and come well thither. If they ſtay longer, ſo as that the Moneth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> be ſpent before they reach the Iſlands, it is more difficult, and they are uſually taken with the <hi>Hurricanos,</hi> as they call them, which are certain violent and contary windes that doe terribly infeſt the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantick and Indian Seas all winter long, from <hi>September</hi> to <hi>March.</hi> And likewiſe in their return homewards they obſerve the ſame time of the yeere there, <hi>viz.</hi> about <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June</hi> the ſhips that are to return for <hi>Spayn,</hi> from all parts of the continent of <hi>America</hi> bend their
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170201:34"/>
courſe for <hi>Havana,</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>Cuba,</hi> which is the place of their general Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous where they are all to meet, and to ſtay one for another till the whol Fleet, eſpecially both of Convoy and Treaſure be come in. Thoſe from the main land, ſet ſayle common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>May</hi> from <hi>Porto Bello,</hi> laden with all the wealth of <hi>Peru,</hi> and whatſoever elſe comes by the ſouth Sea, which is not ſeldome very much from the <hi>Philippine</hi> Iſlands and the eaſt <hi>Indies,</hi> and at <hi>Carthagina</hi> take in more, brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from all parts on that ſide the continent, eſpecially out of the new kingdome of <hi>Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> as they call it. Sayling from <hi>Carthagena</hi> they avoid the coaſt of <hi>Veragua</hi> what they can, by reaſon that the Current, which falleth out of the Ocean into that Gulfe, cometh ſo ſtrongly upon them, that they would never beare up againſt it, at leaſt not without much difficulty and danger; So that they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſeek the Cape Saint <hi>Anthony,</hi> which, as we ſaid, was the moſt weſterly point of the Iſland <hi>Cuba,</hi> at which place the ſhips from <hi>Honduras</hi> doe alſo touch, and ſo they ſayle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a matter of fifty leagues eaſtward, till they come to <hi>Havana.</hi> The ſhips from new <hi>Spayne</hi> beare up Northward as far as the Sound or Bay called <hi>Las Tortugas,</hi> which are
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170201:34"/>
certain Iſlands lying upon the coaſt of <hi>Florida,</hi> and ſo fetch a compaſſe, as it were, of little leſſe then three hundred leagues, before they come to <hi>Havana.</hi> The reaſon of this courſe is, becauſe the American Seas, eſpecially neere upon the coaſt, are frequently ſubject to calms, ſo as the ſhips oftentimes want winde to ſayle with; and therefore to gain, or aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as much as may be of a convenient wind, they are forced to ſteere thus far Northward; from whence, that is, from the Iſlands <hi>Tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas,</hi> they have a ſhort and eaſie cut of a few leagues over to <hi>Havaena.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. When the ſhips are all met in the Port of <hi>Havana,</hi> they preſently ſet ſayle for <hi>Spayne</hi> through the Streites of <hi>Bahama,</hi> and by ſome of the <hi>Leucaiae</hi> Iſlands; not now in a direct courſe Eaſt-ward, as they came in from the Eaſt, but in a greater altitude and more Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly. The reaſon hereof is, becauſe the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or Eaſterly winds, which, as we ſaid, doe conſtantly blow all within the Tropiques, or Torrid zone, doe hinder their paſſage Eaſt-ward, and force them to ſeeke their courſe higher, that is, ſomewhere without the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piques and more towards the North, at leaſt to twenty three or twenty foure degrees of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, where they finde Weſterly windes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170201:35"/>
which carry them homewards as far as the <hi>Azores</hi> or <hi>Tercerae</hi> Iſlands; and the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they goe from the Line, the more ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and certain thoſe windes are, and more fit to make their return; for as much as blowing from the South and ſouth-weſt, they carry them directly Eaſt and North-eaſt, as their voyage lyeth; which is alſo the reaſon why the return which the ſhips make from <hi>America,</hi> or any of thoſe weſtern Iſlands, is uſually more difficult, longer and leſs certain than when they goe out; becauſe, as hath been ſaid, in their going out, when they are once paſſed the <hi>Canarie</hi> Iſlands and got within the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piques (which they uſually doe in four or five dayes ſayling, if the windes favor them) they have conſtantly there an Eaſterly winde, which carries them with full Sayles upon the Iſlands of <hi>America:</hi> whereas in their return, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the uncertainty of the windes by which they ſayle, they are forced to ſeeke a height, as they call it, that is, to fetch a compaſſe Northwards ſometimes more then three or four hundred leagues to gaine a convenient winde. Theſe <hi>Azores</hi> or <hi>Tercerae</hi> Iſlands lie in the Atlantick Ocean, betweene thirty ſeven and fourty degrees of northern Latitude, and are reckoned to be about foure hundred
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170201:35"/>
leagues diſtant from <hi>England;</hi> at which when the ſhips have touched, and ſupplied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſuch neceſſaries as they want, which commonly they doe at the <hi>Tercerae</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlands, but never ſtay to goe on ſhore, they ſet ſayle from thence directly for Saint <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi> or <hi>Cadiz;</hi> which, when the coaſt of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> was free for them, and that they might come up ſecurely with the Cape Saint <hi>Vincent,</hi> they uſually reached in fourteene or fifteene dayes; but now of late, by reaſon of the Warres, and the revolt of that Nation from the Spanyard, they doe a little decline that coaſt, and conſequently come in ſome few dayes later than ordinary.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. BY what hath beene ſaid in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Chapter, the Engliſh will in part perceive how the voyage to the weſt Indies is
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170201:36"/>
commonly made, where the chiefe difficulty or danger of it is, and how avoyded: what may ſeeme wanting to their more perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation ſhall be ſupplied in the particular deſcription of the ſeveral places, Ports and Roades for ſhipping, which belong to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Provinces. At preſent for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the Reader, and to performe an office of due reſpect unto the memorie of ſom brave men of our Nation, who have formerly viſited thoſe coaſts with good advantage to themſelves and honor to the Nation; I ſhall endeavor to give a brief account of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements of ſome of the principall of them, leaving the reſt unto ſuch particular occaſions of remembring them, as will occurre in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe afterwards; and begin firſt with him whoſe memorie is deſervedly moſt famous and honored by all men, for his extraordinary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, experience, and happy conduct at Sea, <hi>viz.</hi> with Sir <hi>Francis Drake.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. This brave Sea-man, at the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of his actions, was Captain of the <hi>Judith,</hi> with Sir <hi>John Hawkins,</hi> in the voyage of <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> one thouſand five hundred ſixty ſeven, and received together with him ſome conſiderable damage and injuries from the Spanyard, in the Port of Saint <hi>John D' <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>llua</hi> of the Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170201:36"/>
contrary to promiſe and agreement with him, and therefore to repayre himſelfe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt beene aſſured by ſome Divines that his Cauſe and Deſigne was juſt, as Maſter <hi>Camden</hi> witneſſeth of him; In the yeere one thouſand five hundred ſeventy two, he ſet out for <hi>America</hi> with two ſhips and a pinnace, whereof that called the <hi>Dragon</hi> was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by himſelf, and at his firſt attempt ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> at that time one of the richeſt Townes of <hi>America:</hi> But in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, happening to receive a wound in one of his feet, which diſabled him very much, he was not able either to hold the place, or to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that rich ſpoyle that lay even in ſight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. For his Company, a little too much diſcouraged with his diſaſter, carried him back to the Ships, almoſt whether he would or no, to the great joy and content of the Spaniards, leaving the town and an infinite maſs of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure behinde them untouch'd; a great part whereof they ſaw with their own eyes in the Governors houſe, namely huge bars of ſilver lying round about the Hall of his Palace, piled up a great height from the ground, ready to be laded and tranſported for <hi>Spain,</hi> as ſoon as the Ships came. But there wanted ſome reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in his company, by whom, being over-borne,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170201:37"/>
he was forced to put to Sea much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Will; ſo that the ſucceſs of his firſt enterpriſe ſerved onely to whet his ſtomach and courage, to give them a ſecond viſit as ſoon as might be. Being ſomewhat recovered of his wound, he falls with his Ships into the Sound of <hi>Darien,</hi> where he lighted upon a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain People called <hi>Symerons,</hi> which are, for the moſt part <hi>Negros,</hi> and ſuch as having been Slaves to the Spaniards, by reaſon of their cruelty and hard uſage are run from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they live in Woods and wild places of the Countrie, in great companies together, not much unlike to other Savages, hating the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards deadly and doing them upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions what miſchief they can. By theſe he gets Intelligence, that a <hi>Requa,</hi> as they there call it, that is, a certain number of Mules (moſt commonly they are fourty or fiftie in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany) laden with Treaſure and other things, was to paſs within few daies from <hi>Panama</hi> in the South-Sea, to <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> to be Ship'd from thence for <hi>Spain;</hi> which he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſolved, if it were poſſible, to ſurprize. Theſe <hi>Requas</hi> from <hi>Panama</hi> to <hi>Ventacruz,</hi> which is about ſix leagues diſtant, in the roade to <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> doe conſtantly travel in the night, by reaſon of the openneſs of the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170201:37"/>
way and the exceſſive heats in the day time: neither had they as then any other guard but onely of thoſe who drive them, and perhaps ſome Gentleman or Officer of the Kings to overſee the Treaſure, by reaſon of their great ſecurity, and that they had liv'd til then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all fear or ſuſpicion of an enemy upon that coaſt; ſo that the enterpriſe ſeemed to them not to be any matter of great difficultie. Wherefore having gained a ſufficient number of thoſe <hi>Symerons</hi> to his party, which he might eaſily doe, with no more than eighteen ſtout and reſolute men of his own, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the reſt to guard and manage the Ships as occaſion might be, they march by night over the Streit of <hi>Darien,</hi> as 'tis called, which is that <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> or neck of Land that joyns the two parts of <hi>America</hi> together, <hi>viz.</hi> the Northern and the Southern part, and contains in that part of it where they were, not above eighteen or twenty miles over, from Sea to Sea, though in length it be many leagues. They were come down undiſcovered within one league of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nama,</hi> and had lodged themſelves in a Grove on each ſide of the road where the <hi>Requa</hi> or company of Mules was to paſs: which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their expectation alſo came, and, as the manner is, ſo tyed one to another, that if you
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170201:38"/>
ſtop one, you make them all ſtand. The <hi>Requa,</hi> which was now coming, belonged for the moſt part of it, to the Treaſurer of <hi>Lima</hi> who with his Daughter and Family, were going for <hi>Spain</hi> with eight Mules in the company laden with Gold, and one with Jewels: which without queſtion had been all taken but for the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion of one Engliſh-man, named <hi>Robert Pike;</hi> who having drank a little too much Strong-water in his martch, was become pot-valiant with it, ſo as his companion could not keep him to his poſtures nor perſwade him to lye cloſe, as they were commanded to doe, till the watch-word ſhould be given; but hearing the Mules come neer, out of a fooliſh bravery and ambition to be the firſt that ſhould give onſet in ſuch an Action, ſtood up; and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his ſhirt uppermoſt, as they did all, the better to diſtinguiſh and know one another in the night, was inſtantly deſcryed by a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Cavaleer that rode a little before the Mules; who, ſuſpecting what it might be, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently turn'd his horſe, and gave ſuch ſpeedy notice thereof, that the principall part of the Treaſure which came behinde, together with the Treaſurer himſelf, his Daughter, and other of his company, were ſaved by a timely retreat, and onely ſome few of the formoſt Mules ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170201:38"/>
which, as they had ſome Treaſure, ſo the Engliſh, knowing how ſoon the Countrie would be alarm'd by reaſon of their diſcovery, durſt ſcarce ſtay to ranſak them, but taking a little of what came next to hand, reſolutely made their way through <hi>Venta cruz.</hi> and ſo by woods and wild foreſts of the Countrie to the Ships, which expected them in the Sound; yet having the good fortune by the way, about <hi>Rio Franciſco,</hi> to meet a ſmaller <hi>Requa</hi> of Mules laden with ſilver and ſome gold, which having better leiſure to examine, they took and carried as much of it as they could away with them to their Ships, burying the reſt in the ground.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In the year 1577 was his voyage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the World, in which to his immortall Fame and Honour, he was the firſt Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of note that encompaſſed this Earths Globe and returned ſafe home again. For though <hi>Ferdinand Magellan</hi> had diſcovered the Streits before him, and gone far, yet he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not to return home, being ſlain at the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luccae</hi> Iſlands, while he was reducing them to the obedience of his new Maſter, the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> This voyage afforded Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> ſome better amends and ſatisfaction from the Spaniards, than the former had done; though
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170201:39"/>
even that was not altogether without profit. For in this he not onely took and well rifled many Towns and places of the Spaniards, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the coaſts of <hi>America</hi> (which they that write the paſſages of the voyage report more at large;) but eſpecially he met with divers rich prizes at Sea; as namely at <hi>Valparaiſo</hi> in the South Sea, a ſhip laden with Wines and as much of the fineſt Gold of <hi>Baldivia</hi> (which is counted the beſt of all) as amounted to thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſeven thouſand Duckets of Spaniſh money, beſide ſilver and other good Commodities. At <hi>Tarapaxa,</hi> upon the ſame coaſt, he met with thirteen bars of pure ſilver, amounting to four thouſand Duckets: And after that with eight hundred pound weight of ſilver, that was going for <hi>Arica</hi> to be ſhipt from thence to <hi>Panama,</hi> and ſo for <hi>Spain,</hi> laden upon <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos,</hi> which are certain Sheep of <hi>America</hi> about the bigneſs of Aſſes, which they uſe as Beaſts of Burthen, eſpecially for the carriage of their Treaſure by Land from place to place. At <hi>Arica</hi> they rifle certain Barks and other ſmall Veſſels which they found in the Port, and take out of them, beſide other Merchandize, fiftie ſeven wedges of pure ſilver, every one of them of the weight of twenty pound a piece, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting in all to one thouſand one hundred
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170201:39"/>
fourty pound weight of ſilver. At <hi>Lima</hi> they enter the Haven, where they found about twelve ſail of ſhips faſt moored at Anchor, their ſails taken off, and all the Mariners ſecure on ſhore; whereupon examining the ſhips, they finde in them, beſides aboundance of Silks, Linnen and other good Commodities which they took, one cheſt full of Ryalls, of Plate, which they thought not good to leave behinde; and (which pleaſed them as much as all the reſt) they got intelligence here of another great Spaniſh ſhip, called the <hi>Caca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuego,</hi> which was at <hi>Payta,</hi> laden with nothing but Treaſure. This ſhip had perceived them at Sea, and was making all the ſail ſhe could for <hi>Panama:</hi> But before ſhe could recover the Port, they purſuing her very hard, about Cape <hi>Franciſco</hi> they get ſight of her, and after ſome ſhort diſpute board her and make her yeild. In this ſhip they found thirteen great Cheſts full of Ryalls of Plate, twenty ſix Tun of other ſilver, four-ſcore pound weight of pure gold, beſides aboundance of Jewels, precious Stones, and other rich Merchandiſe: all which became prize; having alſo in their way while they were purſuing of her, met a ſingle Bark laden outwardly with nothing but ropes and tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for ſhips, but ſeaching more within, they
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170201:40"/>
found no leſs than ſeventy eight pound weight of fine gold, beſide many great and goodly Emeraulds, with other Jewels. They took all, and ſetting their ſail for <hi>Guatulco,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Acapulco,</hi> a noted and much frequented Port of theſe Seas, in their way they meet a ſhip from <hi>China,</hi> laden with Silks and <hi>China</hi> diſhes, of which they take as much as they thought good, and after that rifle the Town of <hi>Guatulco</hi> it ſelf; where, beſide ſome quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of gold, jewels and other plate, they finde one pot of the bigneſs of an Engliſh buſhel, full of Spaniſh Ryals; which having emptied they departed without being farther trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome: onely one <hi>Thomas Moon</hi> an Engliſh man borrowed a chain of gold, which he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to finde about a Spaniard, juſt as they were going out of Town. At this place, finding themſelves reaſonably well laden, and that their ſhips had endured the Sea a long time, they reſolve to return for <hi>England;</hi> which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome time they likewiſe did, by the way of the <hi>Moluccae</hi> and <hi>Philippine</hi> Iſlands, and on the third of <hi>November</hi> 1580, which was the third year of their voyage, they ſafely arrive at <hi>Plimouth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. In the year 1585. this noble and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Sea-man, having been firſt Knighted,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170201:40"/>
and otherwiſe alſo much honoured by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> made another voyage to <hi>America</hi> with a greater number of Ships; in which voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, beſide other places of leſs note, he took and burnt a good part of the Town of St. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo,</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> forcing the Inhabitants to redeem the other part with a ſumme of twenty five thouſand Duckets ready Money. He took alſo <hi>Carthagena,</hi> a Town upon the Continent, and in it <hi>Alonſo Bravo</hi> the Governour, and after the burning of ſome houſes had the ſumme of eleven thouſand Duckets paid him by the Inhabitants to ſpare the reſt. He took likewiſe the Towns of St. <hi>Anthony</hi> and St. <hi>Helena:</hi> But at laſt the Engliſh in the Ships falling ſick of the Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and many dying, he was forced to return for <hi>England</hi> with what he had already got; which upon value was found to amount unto threeſcore thouſand pound ſterling, of cleer prize, beſide two hundred pieces of Braſs Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and fourty of Iron.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. In the year 1595. was his laſt voyage, which proved not altogether ſo ſucceſsfull to him as the former, by reaſon (as is ſuppoſed) of ſome miſunderſtanding betwixt him and Sir <hi>John Hawkins,</hi> who was the other Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall joyned in Commiſſion with him for the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170201:41"/>
expedition. They both ended their dayes in this voyage; and particularly Sir <hi>John Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> before <hi>Port-rico,</hi> as ſoon as ever the ſhips came in ſight of the place. After which Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> being now ſole General, made an attempt upon it, <hi>viz.</hi> upon <hi>Port-rico,</hi> but could doe no more than fire ſome of the ſhips in the Haven, receiving alſo ſome loſs himſelf. Nevertheleſs, after this hee took <hi>Rio de la Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha, Rancheria,</hi> which at that time was a rich Town, through the Trade of Pearl-fiſhing; and laſt of all <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> but found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much Treaſure in it now, as he ſaw the firſt time: And from hence marching by Land towards <hi>Panama,</hi> he had hopes to have ſurpriſed that place: But Sir <hi>Thomas Basker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile,</hi> who commanded a Party of ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fiftie Souldiers upon that deſigne, found the paſſages over ſome mountains ſo difficult, by reaſon of their ſtraitneſs, and the paſſes ſo well fortified and guarded, that he was forced to retreat, not without ſome loſs of men, which the Spaniards knowing the Countrie better than they, and having the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Woods on both ſides of the way as they marched, killed in their return. By reaſon whereof they were forced to put to Sea again; where, not long after, the General
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170201:41"/>
himſelf fell ſick, and partly of a Flux, and partly of griefe, as 'tis ſuppoſed, that things ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded no better, having been hitherto in all his endeavors acquainted onely with ſucceſs and victory, dyed within few daies, before <hi>Porto-bello,</hi> and almoſt within ſight of <hi>Nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre de Dios;</hi> and the Fleet under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Sir <hi>Thomas Baskervile,</hi> returned for <hi>England.</hi>

                        <p n="6">6. The ſecond in renown among Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for the Adventures of <hi>America,</hi> and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for a proſperous and compleat circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navigation of the Ocean, was my honoured Countriman Sir <hi>Thomas Cavendiſh</hi> of <hi>Trimley</hi> in <hi>Suffolk:</hi> who in the year 1586. with three ſhips and about one hundred and twenty men ſet out from <hi>Plimouth</hi> for the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> upon Thurſday the 21. of <hi>July,</hi> having in his company Captain <hi>Francis Pretty</hi> of <hi>Eye,</hi> Captain <hi>Havers,</hi> Captain <hi>Mellis,</hi> and ſome other Gentlemen: and the 25. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> following fell with the point <hi>Sierra Liona</hi> on the coaſt of <hi>Guinny;</hi> and from thence by the 7. of <hi>September</hi> with the Iſland <hi>Madrabamba,</hi> which is one of thoſe about <hi>Cape verde;</hi> a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170201:42"/>
place very convenient for the taking in of freſh water and other neceſſaries for men at Sea, but otherwiſe much ſubject to ſudden claps of Thunder, Lightnings, and Storms, eſpecially in Winter. Their deſigne was for the Streits and the South Sea; wherefore declining the Iſlands and the coaſt of <hi>Terra firma,</hi> as they call it, which is that part of the Continent of <hi>America</hi> which lyeth Weſt and South-weſt of the Iſlands, they ſteer their courſe more direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly South, and by the latter end of <hi>October</hi> they diſcover <hi>Cape Frio</hi> on the coaſt of <hi>Braſil,</hi> and put in with an harbour betwixt the Iſland of St. <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> and the Continent, where they ſtay ſome time, building a new Pinnace, and ſupplying their Ships with ſuch other neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as the Country afforded. After which they put to Sea again, directing their courſe immediatly for the Streits; to which place from the utmoſt coaſt of <hi>Braſil</hi> Southward it s reckoned commonly ſix hundred leagues. <hi>December</hi> the 18. they enter the harbor called <hi>Port deſire,</hi> which is a very good Harbor, and hath a ſafe road for Shipping before it. From hence on the 6. of <hi>January</hi> they put in for the Streits mouth, and after a few daies come to Anchor, not farre from the place where the Spaniards had a deſigne to have built and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyed
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170201:42"/>
a Town for the command of the Streits, and the ſecuring of the paſſage into the South Sea againſt all Nations but themſelves. But, as it appeared, their project took no effect. For of four hundred men left there two or three years before, by <hi>Don Pedro Sarmiento,</hi> to that purpoſe by order of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> there was ſcarce twenty remaining alive when Sir <hi>Thomas Cavendiſh</hi> ſailed that way; the reſt were either ſtarved for want of neceſſarie Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, or deſtroyed by the Natives. They had begun their Town, (which they named St. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>) upon the narroweſt paſſage of the Streits, about fourteen leagues within the mouth to the Southward, and not above half a mile broad, in a place very convenient for their purpoſe, and the Town it ſelf well contrived, with four ſeveral Forts, and every Fort having ſome piece or pieces of Ordinance to defend it; which the Spaniards, when they ſaw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves left deſtitute, and not able to ſubſiſt any longer there, had buried in the ground; but the carriages of them ſtanding open and in view, upon ſearch the pieces themſelves were ſoon found and taken by the Engliſh. Many of the Spaniards that had been left there, as above ſaid, were found dead in their houſes, and lying in their cloaths unburied. Thoſe few
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170201:43"/>
that were alive (which were onely twenty three in all, whereof two Women) although they were ſcarce able to goe or to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet were reſolved, as they ſaid, to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel by land towards <hi>Rio de la Plata,</hi> which is diſtant ſome hundred of leagues from the place where they were; which they had free leave to doe. The Engliſh thereupon made no long ſtay, but having named the place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of St. <hi>Philip, Port-famin,</hi> they departed, holding their courſe ſtill along the Streits, till upon the 24. of <hi>February</hi> they entred the South Sea; having found the whole courſe of the Streits to be about ninetie leagues in length, and to lie in the ſame latitude (or at leaſt with very little difference) at both ends, <hi>viz.</hi> in fiftie degrees and two Terces, South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the line, having good and convenient harbors on both ſides, almoſt at every leagues end; but otherwiſe of a moſt difficult paſſage, by reaſon of many windings and turnings of the Sea, and of ſo many contrary windes, with which from ſeverall coaſts the paſſage is almoſt continually infeſted, but eſpecially in the deep of Winter; at which time by reaſon of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable ſharpneſs of the cold, frequent ſtorms, &amp; huge flights of Snow, their is neither ſailing nor abiding upon thoſe Seas: nor is it
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170201:43"/>
ſo ſafe or eaſie at any time to repaſs, <hi>viz.</hi> back again out of the South Sea into the Atlantick or Northern, as it is to enter by the North Sea.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Beeing got now into <hi>Mare del Zur,</hi> and, as it were, upon the back-ſide of <hi>America,</hi> they ply up and down thoſe coaſts, viſiting, and not ſeldom pillaging the Towns, taking ſuch ſhips as they meet withall, and ſteering their courſe now ſo far North-weſt, till at laſt, upon the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>June</hi> 1587. they double or croſs the Equinoctial line back again, ſailing Northward of it, up towards <hi>Panama</hi> and the coaſt of <hi>New-Spain.</hi> But whether it were that intelligence had been given to thoſe parts of their being upon the coaſts, it was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time before they could ſpie any ſhips ſtirring. The firſt was upon the 9. of <hi>July,</hi> when they took a new ſhip of one hundred twenty Tuns burthen coming from <hi>Puna,</hi> but newly laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched off the Stocks, laden chiefly with ropes and other tackling for ſhips, which they took; and in her one <hi>Michael Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170201:44"/>
after, being the richeſt prize (one of them) that ever was taken and carried off thoſe Seas by Engliſh-men. But firſt they ſail to <hi>Acapul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi> or <hi>Guatulco,</hi> as ſome call it, and having ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled the Town, in the Haven they take a Bark of fiftie Tuns burthen, laden with ſix hundred great bags of Anile, which is a rich ſort of dye, every bag being eſtimated at fourty Crowns; and four hundred baggs of Cacao, which are a kinde of Fruit of <hi>America</hi> of the bigneſs of Almonds, and ſo much eſteemed there, that they paſs both for meat and money; every one of which baggs being valued at ten Crowns, the whole prize in the Barke, beſide what they got in the Town, amounted to twenty eight thouſand Crowns. From hence they ſet ſail for the Bay of <hi>St. Jago,</hi> ſtill Northward; and being come up as farr as the Tropique of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricorne,</hi> they were in ſome diſtreſs for freſh water, having none viſibly neerer them than thirty or fourty leagues. But by the adviſe of the above ſaid <hi>Michael Sancius,</hi> who was a man of long and great experience upon thoſe Coaſts, they digged ſome four or five foot deep in the ground, and found very good freſh water in a ſoyle outwardly dry and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die; which he alſo told them was an uſual experiment in many other places, upon thoſe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170201:44"/>
Coaſts. About the middle of <hi>October</hi> they fall with the Cape <hi>St. Lucar,</hi> on the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the point of <hi>Califormia,</hi> and came to Anchor in the Bay called <hi>Aguada Segura,</hi> where they reſolved to ſtay a while, and wait for the coming of the <hi>St. Anna</hi> aboveſaid; which about the fourth of <hi>November</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appeared to their no little content. She was a ſhip of ſeven hundred Tuns burthen, and Admiral of thoſe Seas; and therefore not onely richly laden but well manned. By noon the Engliſh ſhips got up with her, and gave her a broad-ſide, which ſhe anſwered: but ſoon after put her ſelf to a cloſe fight, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected boarding; which the Engliſh attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, were twice beaten off, and forced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves again to their Ordinance, with which they ſo raked her from ſide to ſide, and ply'd it ſo continually, that after a diſpute of ſome five or ſix hours ſhe was made to yeeld, the Captain hanging out a flag of Truce, and begging mercy for their lives: which the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral readily granted, and thereupon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him to ſtrike ſail and come on board, the Captain, Pilot, and ſome of the principall Merchants did ſo. They were in all an hundred and ninety perſons in the ſhip, men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and profeſſed that their lading was one hundred
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170201:45"/>
twenty two thouſand Pezos of fine Gold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide Silver, aboundance of Silks, Sattins, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask, Musk, Conſerve of Fruits, Druggs, and other of the richeſt Merchandiſe of <hi>India,</hi> of which they could give no certain eſtimate. Now every Pezo we are to know, in ſilver, is valued at eight ſhillings, or not much leſs (for I confeſs there is ſome difference in Authors about the eſtimate of it:) and conſequently in gold (according to the common proportion betwixt gold and ſilver, uſed at the <hi>Indies,</hi> which is twelve for one) a Pezo muſt be worth ninety ſix ſhillings, or 4 <abbr>li.</abbr> 16 <abbr>s.</abbr> ſo that the whole value of the prize could not be much leſs than a million of ſterling money; enough to make them all Gentlemen that ſhared in it. The Spaniards and other people of the ſhip, according to their deſire, were ſet on ſhore at the Port of <hi>Aguada Segura,</hi> with neceſſary proviſions given them, both for their Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and defence in their travell.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. From hence the Engliſh ſet ſail for the <hi>Philippine</hi> Iſlands, and in the ſpace of fourty five dayes ſailing, they reach the Iſlands <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drones,</hi> as they are called, which lie in the way thither, about ſeventeen or eighteen hundred leagues from <hi>Califormia,</hi> whence they came, and in twelve or thirteen degrees of Northen
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170201:45"/>
latitude. They are a very convenient place for the taking in of freſh water, and for the ſupplying of ſhips at Sea, with many neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in ſo long a voyage, but the people wholly barbarous and ſavage, and ſo extreamly given to pilfering and ſtealing, that from thence <hi>Magellan</hi> gave them their name, <hi>viz. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drones,</hi> or the Iſland of Theeves. From hence about the middle of <hi>January</hi> they arrive at <hi>Manilla,</hi> the chief of the <hi>Philippine</hi> Iſlands, and about three hundred ſeventy leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from <hi>Ladrones.</hi> This is counted to be the richeſt Countrie for gold in the World, but ſcarſe of ſilver; ſo as the <hi>Sanguelos,</hi> as they call them, who are great and rich Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of the Country, doe continually trade with the Americans of <hi>New-Spain</hi> for their ſilver, giving weight for weight for it in pure gold. From hence, about the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> they reach the Iſlands of <hi>Javia,</hi> where, by way of barter with the Inhabitants, for ſuch things as they had got upon the coaſts of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> they plentifully ſtore their ſhips with all kinde of Fleſh-meats, Fowles and Fruits neceſſary for their ſubſiſtance homeward, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving at their going away a preſent of the ſame nature from the King of the Countrey, <hi>viz.</hi> two large fat Oxen alive, ten great and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170201:46"/>
fat Hoggs, aboundance of Hens, Ducks, Geeſe, Eggs, a great quantity of Sugar Canes, Sugar in plate, Cocos, Plantans, ſweet Oranges and ſowre, Lymons, great ſtore of good Wines, <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> Salt, with almoſt all maner of Victuals beſide. And it was no more than they had need of in the place where they were. For putting again to Sea, and making for the <hi>Cape de buona Speranza,</hi> or of good hope, which is the utmoſt point of <hi>Africk</hi> South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, they ſailed upon that vaſt Atlantick Ocean, before they could reach the Cape, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle leſs than nine weeks, running a courſe of eighteen hundred and fiftie leagues at leaſt, by Sea, without touching land; ſome recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it to be full two thouſand leagues, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Iſlands of <hi>Java</hi> to the Cape of good Hope. There lyeth about fourty or fiftie leagues ſhort of the Cape a certain Foreland called <hi>Cabo falſo,</hi> becauſe it is uſually at its firſt diſcovery at Sea miſtaken by Mariners for the true Cape. From hence by the eighteenth of <hi>June</hi> 1588. they fall in ſight of the Iſland <hi>St. Helena,</hi> which lyeth in the main Ocean, and, as it were, in the middle way betwixt the Coaſt of <hi>Africk</hi> and <hi>Braſil</hi> in fifteen degrees and fourty eight minutes of Southern latitude, being diſtant from the Cape of good Hope
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170201:46"/>
betwixt five and ſix hundred leagues. It is a pleaſant Iſland, and eſpecially well ſtored with Fruits, as namely Oranges, Lymons, Pomegranats, Pomecitrons, Dates, and ſo proper for Figgs, that the trees bear all the year long, and at any time of the year a man may gather both bloſſoms, green Figgs, and ripe. It affordeth likewiſe good ſtore of wilde Fowle, as Partridges, Pheaſants, a kinde of Turkies, of colour black and white, and as big as ours in <hi>England;</hi> great plentie of Goats, and ſuch aboundance of Swine fat and large, that they live wilde in Heards upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and are not to be taken but by hunting, and with great pains and induſtrie. From hence by the twenty fourth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> they diſcover <hi>Flores</hi> and <hi>Corvo,</hi> two of the <hi>Azores</hi> or <hi>Tercerae</hi> Iſlands; and upon the ninth of <hi>September</hi> following, having firſt ſuffered a terrible ſtorm and tempeſt upon the Engliſh Coaſt, which carried away all their ſails, and put them in great fear and danger of loſing all they had got; yet at laſt by the mercy of God and favour of a good winde they arrived ſafely at <hi>Plimouth.</hi>

                        <p n="1">1. The right honourable <hi>George</hi> Lord <hi>Clifford</hi> Earl of <hi>Cumberland</hi> had before this made ſeveral voyages and Adventures againſt the Spaniards in and towards the parts of <hi>America, viz.</hi> in the years 1586, 89, 92, 94, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with various ſucceſs: But in the year 1597. he more publiquely and avowedly in his own perſon undertook an Expedition with eighteen or twenty good ſhips, and about a thouſand men, being himſelf Admirall and Commander in cheif. He ſet out from <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> on the ſixth of <hi>March</hi> 1597. with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne at firſt to attend the coming out of the Carracks, which goe yearly from <hi>Spain</hi> to the <hi>Weſt-Indies:</hi> But being diſapointed of them, through ſome intelligence that the Spaniards had gotten of his Lordſhips being at Sea, he ſailed on for the coaſt of <hi>America,</hi> reſolving by the way, with the conſent of the principal Commanders with him, to make an attempt upon <hi>St. John de Port-rico,</hi> which is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Town and Port to an Iſland that bears the ſame name, <hi>viz. Port-rico,</hi> lying upon the Coaſt of <hi>America</hi> in eighteen or nineteen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Northern latitude. It was a place,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170201:47"/>
where a few years before, Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> had received ſome loſs, and Sir <hi>Nicholas Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> the Earls brother, been ſlain by a ſhot from one of the Platforms, as hee ſat at ſupper w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the General in the ſhip called the Defiance. The Town ſtandeth in a little Peninſula by it ſelf yet cloſely joyned to the main Iſland towards the North, being a place very well ſeated, and fortified with two ſtrong Caſtles; the one of which is built chiefly for the defence of the Haven, the other of the Town. About three or four leagues diſtance before the Town lyeth a fair ſandy Bay or Beach, which the Sea waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on one ſide; over which the Engliſh at their firſt landing marched directly to the Town, through a thick woody Foreſt, and at the end of that upon a Cawſey of ſome two or three ſcore in length, and of breadth onely to admit three perſons to march a breaſt; at the end thereof they perceived a ſtrong bridge of wood to be built, which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched from one Iſland to the other, and joyned them both together, having alſo ſome Barica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does to defend it, and a Block-houſe with Ordinance on the further ſide of the water. They were informed, that at a low water they might paſs the bridge on either ſide of the Cawſey: whereupon waiting till two of the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170201:48"/>
clock the next morning, when the ebb would be, they attempt the paſſage; but could not gain it, by reaſon the Ordinance played ſo thick and directly againſt the Cawſey: ſo they retreat with the loſs of about fiftie men in all, wounded and killed. Next day the Generall gave command that another Fort, ſtanding upon the principall Iſland, ſhould be attached by Sea. The place was of dangerous acceſs; yet by the help of ſome Musketeers that were gotten upon certain Rocks within the Iſland, ſo neer that they could play upon them in the Fort, within little more than an hours ſpace, the Spaniards that kept it quitted the place, and they that attached it by Sea, in boats entred; howbeit the ſhip that brought them neer it was her ſelf caſt away upon the Rocks at the ebbing of the water, as it was at firſt feared that ſhe would be. The Spaniards that had quitted the Fort, together with the chief of the Town that were not already fled, retire and betake themſelves to another Fort, called the Fort <hi>Mora,</hi> giving the Engliſh leave to enter the Town, &amp; alſo to block up the Fort where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were: So that in few dayes they were content to render themſelves upon ſuch terms as the Admiral offered them, and the Engliſh became Maſters of all. The Town and Forts
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170201:48"/>
being thus taken, the Generals deſign was to have kept the place; which might eaſily enough have been done: But it was not long before the Engliſh, partly through ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemperature of the aire, which in that place, it being a flat and low Iſland, is not ſo pure and cleer as in the higher part of the Country, but chiefly through their own intemperance and irregular dyet and drinking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the place af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording them plenty of all things, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of many luſcious and ſtrange Fruits, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and dyed ſo faſt of the Calenture, bloody-Flux, and other hot diſeaſes, that after nine or ten weeks holding the place, and ſix hundred of his men dead, as aboveſaid, his Lordſhip was forced to return for <hi>England,</hi> doing no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hurt to the Town, ſave onely the bringing away of four ſcore pieces of Ordinance, the Bells of their Church, and ſome quantity of Sugar and Ginger: nor ſuſtaining other loſs himſelf in the whole voyage, than of three ſcore men ſlain upon taking the Town, the ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred dying of the Flux and other diſeaſes, the <hi>Pegaſus</hi> wracked upon <hi>Goodwin Sands,</hi> the old Frigot upon <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſhent</hi> on the coaſt of <hi>Normandy</hi> with fourty men in them, and a Bark loſt by tempeſt about the <hi>Bermudas.</hi> The Admiral at his returning, left Sir <hi>John Barcley</hi> behind
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170201:49"/>
him with ſome men and ſhips, to compound with the Spaniards for the Town: but they ſeeing the General himſelf was already gone, and knowing the condition of the Engliſh to be ſuch, by reaſon of the ſickneſſes amongſt them, that it was not likely Sir <hi>John</hi> would ſtay long after him, made no great haſte to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, but found means to protract the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs ſo long, that at laſt the Engliſh were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to leave it to them, and that without burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or doing any other prejudice to it, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Admiral had given order before; being a perſon of great honour, and one that ſought honour more than ſpoyle, by the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; as the Spaniards well found.</p>

                        <head>Of Captain <hi>John Oxenham.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p n="1">1. Hitherto we have ſpoken of ſuch Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers, and voyages to the New World, as were either publiquely or privatly owned and avowed by the State; here followeth one, who, as it ſeems, wanted that priviledge, going onely upon <hi>jus Naturae,</hi> as he conceived, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover that by force, which he complained was by force taken from him, and having no other means left him whereby to obtain his right. This was Captain <hi>John Oxenham,</hi> a man who
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170201:49"/>
had formerly been Servant, Souldier, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner with Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> and together with him ſuſtained ſome loſs by the Spaniards at the Port of <hi>St. John D'ullua:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, notwithſtanding his proceedings may ſeem to want ſome formalities of Law to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie them, and that the Spaniards counted and ſentenced him for a Pyrate, becauſe he wanted Commiſſion; yet ſeeing his Actions were not altogether groundleſs, and that his attempt was ſo memorably daring and hardy, and alſo ſo well and happily managed, ſo far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned himſelf, I ſhall not fear to add his name, and a brief report of his Action, to the reſt of theſe worthies.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. This man, as was ſaid, had ſerved Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> in his Voyages and Adventures at Sea a long time, and had thereby gained him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf no ſmall skill in Maritime affairs, and was particularly acquainted with the Coaſts and Commodities of the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> ſo that by the year 1575. he was got to be Captain of a ſhip of a hundred &amp; fourty Tuns burthen, carrying ſeventy men in her: with which in the year above-ſaid he ſet ſail for <hi>America,</hi> and arriveth at the Sownd of <hi>Darien,</hi> at that very place, where a few years before, Sir <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Drake</hi> had fallen acquainted with the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meroons
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170201:50"/>
that put him upon the deſigne for <hi>Panama</hi> by Land, and of ſurprizing the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Mules; a Place and People which Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Oxenham</hi> knew very well, and intended to make uſe of them now. Nor was it long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he lighted upon ſome of them ſtragling up and down in the wildes of the Country: but they tell him that the Mules travel not now, but with a ſtrong guard of Souldiers; which was ſomewhat contrary to his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and alterd his deſigne quite: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, being reſolved to Act ſomething worthy of a man, before he returned, it ſerved not ſo much to diſanimate him, as to put him and his companions upon a more hopefull, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all a more hard attempt: which was, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there was now but little hopes of doing themſelves any good by land, as they hoped, nor by Sea on that ſide they were, they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to viſit the other Coaſts, and to trie their fortunes upon the South Sea. To this end the Captain brings his own ſhip on ground, and, as well as he could, covers her with boughs and ſuch other rubbiſh as the place afforded; and burying his Ordinance in the ground, he with his company and ſix Negros to conduct them, march by Land towards the Coaſt of <hi>Panama</hi> and <hi>Peru.</hi> Having gone a matter of twelve or
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170201:50"/>
fourteen leagues they come to a River, which, as the Symeroons told him, ran directly into the South Sea. Here they cut down wood, build themſelves a Pinnace of about fourty five foot long by the keel, and in her they put to Sea, making towards the Iſland of Pearls, which lyeth about twenty five leagues diſtant from <hi>Panama</hi> toward the South, hoping it would not be long before ſome ſhips from <hi>Peru</hi> or other parts of the South, would be ſailing that way for <hi>Panama.</hi> So that by the way, however Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> hath deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly the honour of firſt diſcovering the South Sea to Engliſh-men, <hi>viz.</hi> by the onely open and known way of the Streits; yet it muſt be acknowledged, that Captain <hi>Oxenham</hi> was the firſt Engliſhman that ever ſailed upon it with command.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. He had not waited long, but there comes a Bark from <hi>Quito</hi> (which is a Province of the Countrie of <hi>Peru</hi>) laden with Commodities, and having in her beſides of fine gold ſixtie thouſand <hi>Pezos,</hi> which he took; and within ſix dayes after another from <hi>Lima,</hi> wherein he had no leſs than two hundred thouſand Pezos of ſilver, in barrs. What a Pezo is, both in ſilver and gold hath been already ſaid, in the relation of Sir <hi>Thomas Cavendiſh</hi> his voyage.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170201:51"/>
There are that render theſe <hi>Pezos pounds of weight,</hi> ſaying that he took two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>pound weight</hi> of ſilver, and ſixtie thouſand <hi>pound weight</hi> of gold, which perhaps is not ſo well done, and may make the ſumme to ſeem leſs credible: for as much as every <hi>pound weight</hi> of ſilver, after the ordinary rate of five ſhillings the ounce, is worth four pound of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in Coyne; and likewiſe every <hi>pound weight</hi> of gold, according to the common proportion betwixt gold and ſilver, which at the Indies is twelve for one, is worth fourty eight pound in Coyn; and conſequently the whole value of the prize would amount to above three millions in gold and ſilver together, <hi>viz.</hi> two millions, eight hundred, and fourſcore thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound in gold, and eight hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound in ſilver; which perharps every body will not beleeve. I think it therefore better to expreſs it by the uſual term and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of a Pezo in Spaniſh, which is commonly ſaid to be eight ſhillings of Engliſh money: and ſo the whole value of the prize taken amounted to nine hundred and ſixtie thouſand pound ſterling in gold, and to fourſcore thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound in ſilver: which being found a competent prize, and enough to ſatisfie reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable men, they retire with their Pinnace up
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170201:51"/>
the River, intending to make what haſte they could to their ſhip. But as it unhappily fell out, through the covetouſneſs and diſſention of ſome of his company, ſo much time was ſpent before they could agree about ſharing of their bootie, and how to tranſport it to their ſhip, that the Spaniards at <hi>Panama</hi> had notice of them; whereupon ſhips were preſently ſent out to purſue them at Sea, and likewiſe ſome Souldiers to intercept their return by Land. The Captain himſelf, through the obſtinacie and willfulneſs of ſome of his company, was forced to leave the Treaſure with them, and to travel ſome leagues up into the Countrie to finde Negros that might help him to carry it, his own men refuſing to doe it but at their own demands, and quarrelling with him for larger pay. In the mean time the Spaniſh ſhips that ſought him at Sea come to the mouth of the River where they were gone up, and by the Feathers of certain Henns, which the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh had taken, and, as it ſeems, plucked there, gheſſed preſently that they might be gone up the River; and thereupon putting in after them, they ſoon took both them and their prize together. The Captain, as I ſaid, was abſent: but by reaſon that either the Negros, or elſe ſome of the Engliſh themſelves that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170201:52"/>
were taken, had diſcovered their ſhip in the Sownd, neither he nor any of the reſt eſcaped, but were all, firſt or laſt, met with by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards; and having no Commiſſion to ſhew for what they did, were executed every man of them, onely two boyes ſaved. Thus, ended the ſtout and reſolute Captain <hi>Oxenham;</hi> the Juſtice of whoſe cauſe I will not undertake to diſpute with his Adverſaries. I could wiſh it had been as perfectly juſt in all reſpects, as it was gallant and bravely managed on the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains part; inſomuch that his very enemies, who made him dye for it, doe yet admire and extoll it: being ſpoyled onely through the paſſion, covetouſneſs, and ſelf-will of ſome of his company, whoſe lives paid for their follie.</p>

THe Spaniards and other Nations have not altogether the ſame ſenſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſituation or extent of the <hi>Weſt-Indies:</hi> Commonly they are taken to ſignifie that part of the World lately diſcovered, which lyeth Weſtward of the Worlds general and fixed Meridian, which, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion, runneth through the <hi>Azores</hi> or <hi>Tercerae</hi> Iſlands, from one Pole to another, thereby dividing the Globe of the Earth into two equall parts, or Hemiſpheres. The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards looking to the pretended Donation or Grant, made by Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth, to the Kings of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Leon, of whatſoever Lands or Iſlands diſcovered, or that ſhould be diſcovered by them ſailing Weſtward of the</hi> Azores, <hi>whether upon the coaſt of India or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,</hi> doe not ſeldom comprehend under the notion of the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> and the New

World, the <hi>Moluccae</hi> and <hi>Philippine</hi> Iſlands, with ſome other places in the Indian Sea, though they lie cleerly in the Eaſtern Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere: which, becauſe it ſeems not ſo proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, and doth otherwiſe beget obſcuritie in the Authors that treat of this ſubject, I thought it not amiſs to give this <hi>Item</hi> of it here. According therefore to the moſt ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie and general acception of the word, <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> or the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> is that part of the World lately diſcovered, which lyeth Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the <hi>Azores,</hi> and the Worlds Meridian, and poſſeſſeth, either in Sea or Land, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of that Hemiſphere, <hi>viz.</hi> the Weſtern Hemiſphere of the World; the Land it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>America,</hi> being bounded Eaſtward and and South-Eaſt with the Atlantick Ocean; and Weſtward, and to the South-weſt with <hi>Mare del Zur,</hi> the Northern borders of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not yet known. A Countrie of ſo vaſt an extent, that ſome have equalled it to all the other three parts of the World, <hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> together, to whom I can hardly aſſent; yet doe readily acknowledge it to be much larger than any one, yea perhaps than any two of the other parts, could they be exactly compared. It lyeth for the moſt part North and South, not directly, but ſomewhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170201:53"/>
in the Southern part of it, Eaſtward, and in the Northern part Weſtward, being in length, as 'tis commonly ſuppoſed, from <hi>Terra Magellanica</hi> in the South, to <hi>Eſtetiland</hi> and the further parts of <hi>Quivira</hi> in the North, above a thouſand nine hundred and ſeaventy ſeaven Spaniſh leagues, which according to Engliſh or common meaſure, is more than ſix thouſand miles; reaching from 60. degrees of Northern latitude (for ſo farr it hath been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered already by Land) unto 53 degrees of Southern: The breadth of it, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>St. Michael,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Piura,</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Quito</hi> upon the South Sea, to the <hi>Prefecture</hi> and Town of <hi>Parayba</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Braſil,</hi> where it is thought to be broadeſt, is reckoned to be 1300. leagues, and in the whole compaſs to contain little leſs than ten thouſand leagues, or thirty thouſand common Engliſh miles.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The whole Countrie lyeth in the form of two <hi>Peninſula's,</hi> or large demy-Iſlands, joyned together by an Ihſtmus or neck of Land called the Streit of <hi>Darien,</hi> of about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles in length, but in breadth, <hi>viz.</hi> from one Sea to another in many places, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially about <hi>Panama</hi> and <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> not above ſeventeen and eighteen miles over.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170201:54"/>
They that reſemble the Country to the form of a <hi>Pyramis</hi> reverſed, I ſuppoſe, would be underſtood onely of the Southern or Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian part, as 'tis called; neither is it ſo eaſie to conceive, where they lay the Baſis of it: if from the Coaſt of <hi>Peru</hi> Weſtward, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt point of <hi>Braſil</hi> towards the Eaſt, as by the form of the Maps 'tis moſt probable they doe; the ſpire, or top, of their Pyramis will have ſomewhat an obtuſe or blunt point; in as much as the Countrie of <hi>Magellanica,</hi> which lyeth upon the Streits and maketh the point of the Pyramis, is by confeſſion ſome hundred of leagues over from Eaſt to Weſt, or from the Atlantick to the South Sea, the Streits themſelves running a courſe of one hundred and ninety leagues all along the Coaſt of it; and conſequently muſt be of a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bredth than the Streit of <hi>Darien;</hi> where 'tis evident the Land of <hi>America,</hi> or rather of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru,</hi> contracts it ſelf into a much ſharper point or Pyramis, <hi>viz.</hi> betwixt <hi>Panama</hi> and <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> as hath been ſaid. To me (taking the whole Country, or both <hi>Peninſulas</hi> together) <hi>America</hi> ſeems rather to reſemble ſome rich Uſurers bagge, tyed faſt in the mid'ſt; the one end whereof is rich and well ſtuff'd with Crowns, the other empty and looſe; So ſeems

                        <hi>America.</hi> The Southern part thereof contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the golden Countries of <hi>Peru, New-Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada, Caſtella aurea, Chile,</hi> and the reſt, like the full bottome of the bagge, ſwells and ſpreads it ſelf with a large circumference and border, both Eaſt and Weſt: the Northern part, eſpecially beyond <hi>New Spain</hi> and the Streit of <hi>Darien,</hi> which is as it were, <hi>the hand upon the Purſe,</hi> and that part, by which the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike King both holds and commands all the reſt, as the Provinces thereof ſeem to lye more ſcattered one from another, and not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted together, as conſiſting much of Iſlands, and the Continent it ſelf frequently divided with Bays and Inlets of the Sea, ſo in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the Southern Provinces, it affords but little of thoſe precious Commodities, for which <hi>America's</hi> acquaintance is ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by other Nations, and with equall care, policie, and good ſucceſs hitherto, forbidden by the Spaniards.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is a queſtion among Coſmographers, too great for me to determine, whether <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> be really Continent or Iſland, that is, whether the Northern Borders of it be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> or divided from it by ſome narrow Sea or Frith, as it is to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from thoſe, as yet undiſcovered, Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170201:55"/>
Lands, which lie on the other ſide of <hi>Magellan</hi>'s Streits? It ſeems to be the more common Opinion, at leaſt amongſt Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that it is an Iſland, though a huge one, wholly ſurrounded by the Sea, and divided from <hi>Aſia</hi> by a certain Frith or narrow Sea, which they call the Streits of <hi>Anian,</hi> from a Province of the Aſiatique Tartarie which bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that name, and is ſuppoſed to border upon thoſe Streits. Nor doe there want ſome preſumptions of probability for it; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, a report of <hi>Pliny,</hi> out of <hi>Cornelius Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos,</hi> an ancient and credible Author, of certain Indians that were driven by ſtorm upon the Coaſts of <hi>Suevia,</hi> or <hi>Suaben,</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> in their Canoa's or little Boats; in which it had been impoſſible, for them to have come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by any other paſſage, than by the North parts of <hi>America:</hi> Impoſſible, I ſay, to have come any other way, and not to have touched firſt at ſome other Lands, or Iſlands by the way, <hi>viz.</hi> upon the Coaſts of <hi>Barbary, Spain, Portugall,</hi> the <hi>Azores,</hi> or <hi>Canarie</hi> Iſlands; by reaſon that a ſhip, or any thing elſe, floating at Sea, when it is not hindred or diverted by ſtorms, tide, or ſome other accidentall cauſe, naturally of it ſelf, and by the proper courſe and conduct of the waters onely, beareth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170201:55"/>
Land: Beſide that, it is not very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, they could have ſubſiſted alive, and not been ſtarved in ſo long journey, as to have come by <hi>Magellans</hi> Streits, or the Atlantick Ocean. There be extant likewiſe ſome poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive teſtimonies of certain perſons, that ſay, they have really paſſed that way, as of one <hi>Salvatierra</hi> a Portugheſe, and <hi>F. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rdanetta</hi> a Religious man, mentioned by Mr. <hi>Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in his Geographie; and of one <hi>Juan de Fuca,</hi> is he is called, an ancient Greek Pilot, mentioned by Mr. <hi>Purchas,</hi> in his third part of <hi>Eng. Voyages, pag.</hi> 849.850. who is ſaid to have lived fourty years in <hi>America,</hi> and in his own perſon to have diſcovered the paſſage in the year 1592. at the command of the Vice-Roy of <hi>Mexico.</hi> But of what credit theſe teſtimonies ſhall be thought, for ought I know, the Reader muſt judge: I onely report them as I finde them. I could heartily wiſh, for the honor and great advantage which the Nation might reap by it, by having thereby a free paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage into the South Sea, and conſequently a much ſhorter cut to the other Indies; that the paſſage were diſcovered, and the Engliſh well Maſters of it, eſpecially if it could be made ſo eaſily as the ſaid Pilot <hi>Juan de Fuca</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and in ſo ſhort a time as is the ſpace of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170201:56"/>
twenty daies; or from the Coaſt and neer the latitude of <hi>Virginia,</hi> as ſome others have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, and ſeem to hope that it may. But for my part (ingenuouſly to ſpeak what I think) I fear the Proverb may ſomwhat prevail upon the Engliſh in this point, <hi>Quod volumus faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lè credimus,</hi> and that the deſire we have to finde ſuch an advantageous paſſage is not the leaſt argument to make us think, <hi>That it is to be found.</hi> Not that I conclude there is none; for that were to be too injurious againſt the poſitive depoſitions of thoſe who are ſaid to have made it, and which I my ſelf cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove by any evident reaſon: And the report of Sir <hi>Thomas Button,</hi> mentioned in the ſame Mr. <hi>Purchas,</hi> concerning a ſtrong Tide com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Weſt much about the ſame lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, ſeems to add ſomething to the probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the paſſage: but that I think the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of it, eſpecially from the Land on this ſide, or from any part of <hi>Europe</hi> immediatly, is a buſineſs of ſo great difficulty, that it is almoſt all one as if there were no paſſage. For how many of our own Nation, worthy men, and of great experience and skil at Sea, (not to ſpeak of our Neighbours the Dutch, a People no leſs industrious and skilfull) have with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted courage and reſolution undertaken
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170201:56"/>
it at ſeveral times with great hazard of their lives and charge to the Adventurers, yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies forced to return without effect? Thoſe Northern Seas whither they ſail Eaſtward or Weſtward, being ſo barred and block'd up, as it were, with huge and perpetual mountains of Ice, their nights ſo long, their day-time ſo dark, by reaſon of the continual foggs, miſts, and flights of ſnow, which are ever and anon falling, and laſtly the weather generally in thoſe parts ſo extreamly cold and freezing, even in the mideſt of ſummer, that all things well conſidered, it may ſeem an attempt of ſmall hope; and that Divine Providence by the order of Nature it ſelf, or by the natural frame and conſtitution of this ſublunarie and terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial World, hath ſet a <hi>non plus ultra</hi> to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane indeavors that way. Nevertheleſs if the State think it expedient to make yet any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tryall in the buſineſs, and to command the proſecution of it, with more publique au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority reſolution and ſtrength than as yet hath been uſed about it, as from ſo great wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome I cannot but expect much, ſo for the ends aboveſaid, <hi>viz</hi> the honour and advantage of the Nation, according to my dutie, I ſhall wiſh all happie ſucceſs to it. But this perhaps will ſeem a digreſſion; I ſhall therefore return.</p>

                        <pb n="94" facs="tcp:170201:57"/>4. The greateſt part of <hi>America</hi> that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited or commanded by the Spaniards (to ſpeak in the language of Aſtronomie) lyeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Tropicks of <hi>Cancer</hi> and <hi>Capricorn,</hi> or within the Torrid Zone, as it is called, but to ſpeak more intelligibly to the general capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Readers, it lyeth in the middle part of the World in reſpect of North and South, ſo as it receives the raies of the Sun almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly, ſtriking upon it all the year long, and conſequently ſhould be much ſubject to heats and droughts, as the Countries of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia, Aegypt, Lybia,</hi> and other parts of the World that lye in the ſame parallel, generally are. But with <hi>America</hi> it is not ſo: there is no Countrie in the World generally more temperate in reſpect of heat and cold, than the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> be. The reaſon of the difference is partly the <hi>Briſes,</hi> as they call them, or the Levant windes, which perpetually blow upon it from the Eaſt on both ſides of the Aequator, together with other windes from all coaſts of the Sea, that doe much qualifie and abate the heats, which otherwiſe, 'tis probable, would be not a little troubleſome, eſpecially in the plain Countrie and maritime parts of it: and partly the very ſite and poſition of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie it ſelf, which more within Land is generally
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170201:57"/>
mountainous and hilly: ſo that from whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Coaſt or part of the World you enter the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> travelling forward, you ſtill mount upward and aſcend, as it were, in ſome parts, to a very great height; which is true, not onely of the Continent or main-Land, but alſo of all or moſt of the Iſlands adjoyning: by reaſon whereof, not onely the Aire, for the moſt part, is found to be temperate, coole, and healthfull, but the valleys and lower grounds alſo very fertil and pleaſant. Howbeit not in all parts of the Countrie alike, either for the one or the other, <hi>viz.</hi> either in reſpect of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of Aire, or fertility of Soyle. For we are to know, the Countrie of <hi>America</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth generally of three ſeveral ſorts of Land: The firſt whereof is flat, and, as it were, level ground, which lyeth for the moſt part upon the Sea Coaſts, and takes up no ſmall part of the Countrie, by reaſon that, as we have ſaid, <hi>America</hi> is wholly, or at leaſt for more than three parts of four ſurrounded and environed by Sea. The ſecond is extream high Land, as conſiſting of the <hi>Andes,</hi> as they are called, which are a certain ridge or row of mountains, of ſuch incredible altitude or height, that they are not thought to be paralleld in the world again. Theſe run in a long and continued
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170201:58"/>
ridge through the whole Countrie of <hi>Peru,</hi> or the Southern part of <hi>America,</hi> from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Popayan</hi> almoſt up to <hi>Magellans</hi> ſtreits, above a thouſand leagues together; the tops of them being in moſt parts about twenty leagues over, and ſo perpetually covered with ſnow, that they are not much inhabited or known, ſave onely upon the borders, or lower skirts of them. The third is a mean Land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt both, conſiſting partly of mountains of leſſer height, yet for the moſt part running pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel with the Andes through the whole Countrie of <hi>Peru</hi> Southward, and partly of vallies or low-land; both which together they call the <hi>Sierra</hi> or Hill-Countrie. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this diverſity of ſite, or poſition in the ſeveral parts or Provinces of <hi>America</hi> we are to expect a difference both in the temperature of the Aire, and in the qualitie of the Soyle. As for example, the Plains of <hi>America</hi> (for ſo they are commonly called) that is, the flat and lower parts of it, which lie upon the Sea Coaſts, are generally hot and neither ſo much inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor counted ſo healthfull; yet neither are they ſcorched with any intolerable heats, by reaſon of the Briſes, and thoſe other frequent Sea gales, which, as we ſaid, are continually blowing upon them, and as it were, cooling
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170201:58"/>
them from all parts: Nor yet are they parched with any immoderate droughts, although it never rains upon thoſe parts of the Countrie, at any time of the year<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for inſtead thereof, there falls continually every morning a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain dew, which after a time condenſates, and turns into ſmall pearly drops of water, which doth not a little refreſh the Countrie. Beſide that, this part of <hi>America,</hi> being a flat and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel Countrie, it is ſo farr from being rendred incommodious for want of water, that in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places it may ſeem to partake ſomewhat too much of that Element; as all along the Coaſt of <hi>Braſil,</hi> and alſo on the other ſide of <hi>America</hi> Weſtward; where the Country for a great part of it is rendred unhabitable, by reaſon of the great aboundance of Waters, which falling with ſuch huge Torrents, as they doe, from the mountains more within Land, and finding no convenient paſſage in thoſe le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel and flat Countries, doe many times drown the Lands on each ſide of them for a great ſpace together; or at leaſt render the Countrie leſs profitable and uſefull, by opening ſo many great lakes, or ſtanding waters, in all parts of the Countrie, and many of them of ſuch vaſt extent, that they ſeem rather to be pettie Seas within Land; and by turning ſo much of the other
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170201:59"/>
Land into mariſh or fenny ground, as upon the Coaſts of <hi>America</hi> is every where to be ſeen.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Contrariwiſe upon the <hi>Andes,</hi> and in many parts of the Province of <hi>Chile,</hi> eſpecially more towards the Streits, the Aire is extream cold, and not well to be indured; and beſide, ſo ſtrangely ſharp and piercing of mens bodies, that for ſtrangers, and ſuch whoſe bodies are not uſed to it, it is not a little dangerous to travell that way. They report, that in the midſt of Land it makes men Sea-ſick, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the ſame alterations, vomitings and other diſtemperatures of the ſtomach and body, but much more violent and extream, which men commonly feel at their firſt going to Sea. This happens chiefly upon the mountains <hi>Pariacaca, Lucana,</hi> and <hi>Sora,</hi> which are part of the <hi>Andes.</hi> In other places, <hi>viz.</hi> about <hi>las Punas,</hi> which are another ridge of mountains, though leſſer, running parallel with the <hi>Andes</hi> in the Province of <hi>Chile,</hi> the quality of the Aire is ſuch, that it takes away a mans life ſuddenly, and before he feeleth any ſenſible alteration or griefe in himſelf, either from within or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. Men drop down dead as they travel in the way, without finding any pain or ſickneſs in themſelves: others loſe their hands and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170201:59"/>
feet as they travel, or at leaſt ſome of their fingers and toes, which fall and ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the other parts of the body, with no more ſenſe or feeling, than when a rotten apple falls from the tree that bare it. And this, how fabulous ſoever it may ſeem, yet is it a certain truth. <hi>Acoſta,</hi> and other Authors of approved credit, doe avouch it from their own experience, <hi>viz.</hi> of what they had found and felt in themſelves, and from what they had obſerved and ſeen with their eyes in others: and it ſeems confirmed by Mr. <hi>Purchas</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who, in the relation of Sir <hi>Thomas Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendiſh</hi> his ſecond voyage to the Streits (which to his great misfortune happened to be in the deep of Winter, and when the weather there is moſt intolerably cold and freezing, as hath been formerly ſaid) reports a like acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, namely of one <hi>Harris</hi> an Engliſh-man, who going to blow his noſe, had the ill hap to pull it off and caſt it into the fire, before he was aware: and of one <hi>Anthony Knivett</hi> of the ſame company, whoſe toes came off with his ſtockings in like maner, through the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of cold in thoſe parts.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But the <hi>Sierra</hi> or mean Land, <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the height of the <hi>Andes</hi> and the lowneſs of the Plaines, as it takes up the farr greater
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170201:60"/>
part of the Countrie, ſo is it generally more temperate, healthfull and agreable to mens bodies: It is alſo aboundantly well watered with fair and pleaſant Rivers, ſuch as for the multitude of them, and the largeneſs of their reſpective ſtreams are not to be paralleld in any other part of the World: It injoyeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly its proper ſeaſons of rain and fair wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, no leſs than <hi>Spain</hi> it ſelf, and many other Countries of <hi>Europe;</hi> by reaſon whereof the Soile is likewiſe rendred ſo exceedingly fat and luſty, that it is to be admired what they report concerning the goodneſs and fertility of it. They have in many places two Harveſts in a year, (as in the Iſland of <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi>) reaping in and about <hi>October</hi> that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they ſow in <hi>Aprill</hi> or <hi>May;</hi> and in <hi>May,</hi> that which they ſow in <hi>October:</hi> yea, ſome ſay, there is no kinde of Grain ſown at the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> but in ſome places or other it will ripen and be fit to reap within four moneths. All kinde of hearbs, roots, or whatſoever fruits of the Garden, as Melons, Cucumbers, &amp;c. in ſixteen or twenty dayes at fartheſt. In ſome places a buſhel of <hi>Maiz</hi> ſown (which is their moſt ordinary bread-corn) yeeldeth two hundred buſhels of increaſe; and a buſhel of the beſt wheat, three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore; and 'tis ſaid to be an uſual thing there,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170201:60"/>
of an acre of ground well husbanded, to reap two hundred buſhels, or twenty five quarters of any Grain whatſoever. As for Fruits, I mean ſuch as are natural and of the proper growth of the Countrie, there is incredible plenty and variety of ſeveral kindes, and thoſe incomparably fairer, larger, bigger, more lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious and pleaſing to the taſte than are to be found elſewhere in the World: And as for ſuch as have been tranſplanted thither out of <hi>Europe,</hi> as moſt kindes of European fruits have been, <hi>viz.</hi> Apples, Pears, Oranges, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Quinces, Figgs, &amp;c. they doe not onely thrive well, but in a ſhort time are exceedingly improved and bettered both in bigneſs, beauty, and taſte, onely through the richneſs and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtineſs of the Soile. It is ſaid, that an eare of wheat hath been ſeen there as big about as a mans arme in the brawn, and of above a ſpan in length, and to have had growing in it above a thouſand grains: A Raddiſh root hath been likewiſe ſeen there of the ſame bigneſs and length, <hi>viz.</hi> of a mans arme, very tender of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and of a pleaſant taſte. And 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly obſerv'd, that for Wheat and other grain of <hi>Europe,</hi> they chooſe out a leſs luſty and colder ſoile; becauſe otherwiſe to ſow it in the fatteſt and richer ground, it would run all out
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170201:61"/>
into ſtalk of a huge height indeed, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out earing or ever bearing of Corn. There be whole Woods and Foreſts, as it were, of Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Lymons, Quinces, and other ſuch fruit, both for bigneſs and beauty far exceeding the common ones of <hi>Spain,</hi> of the ſame kinde. At the Cittie of <hi>Cuſco,</hi> which is the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis of <hi>Peru,</hi> they have ripe Grapes all the year long; and in diverſe parts of the Countrie there be trees that bear fruit one half of the year on one ſide, and the other half year on the other, as <hi>Acoſta</hi> reporteth of his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, of a Fig-tree in <hi>Malla,</hi> nigh the <hi>Citie of Kings:</hi> and others ſpeak as much of other fruits in other parts of the Countrie. And ſo it is likewiſe for Cattel, I mean ſuch as have been brought thither out of <hi>Europe,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great or ſmal Cattel, as Kine, Sheep, Hogs, Goats, &amp;c. the increaſe that hath been of them would ſeem to be beyond beliefe, but that all Authors affirm it. In the Iſland of <hi>Hiſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niola</hi> (and 'tis likewiſe the ſame in many parts of the Continent, and other Iſlands beſide) there are many thouſands of Cattel, that live wilde in Heards upon the mountains having no certain owner; ſo as it is free for any man to kill them that will: and thouſands of them are every yeer killed onely for their Hides and

                     <p n="1">1. BUt to give ſome further aſſurance of the general richneſs and fertility of the Countrie at the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> it is requiſite that we ſpeak ſomthing more in particular, of the ſeveral Commodities and Fruits which <hi>America</hi> yeeldeth. Theſe I diſtinguiſh into two ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> Commodities Natural and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantile. I call thoſe commodities Natural which are ſo proper to the Place and Countrie of <hi>America,</hi> that as they grow there, ſo are they, at leaſt for the moſt part, there likewiſe conſumed and ſpent, as not being ſo fit or not ſo much uſed to be tranſported thence into any other parts by way of Merchandiſe; of which kinde, I ſuppoſe the moſt part of their Grain, Fruit, and Cattle may be reckoned to be. I call thoſe Commodities Mercantile, which are generally brought from thence, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170201:62"/>
in ſo great aboundance, by the Merchants that trade in thoſe parts; of which ſort are chiefly the Metals of <hi>America, viz.</hi> Gold and Silver, to which muſt be added the great quantity of Pearle, precious ſtones and Jewels, yearly brought from thence, their Sugars, diverſe ſorts of Spicery and Druggs, aboundance of Cotton wooll and Cloath, Hides, many kindes of wood, as well Medicinal as other: of all which my purpoſe is to ſpeak ſomething, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come to the particular deſcription of the ſeveral Provinces in which they are found; but yet briefly, according as I am oblieged, and referring the Reader for more full ſatisfaction upon this ſubject, in caſe he deſire it, to <hi>Acoſta</hi> his Hiſtorie of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and to <hi>Oviedo</hi> his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Hiſtorie, whom I chiefly follow, and who treat of theſe things more at large. And firſt I ſhall begin with thoſe Commodities which I call Naturall; and amongſt them with ſuch as are of moſt general neceſſity and uſe for the ſuſtenance of mans life, <hi>viz.</hi> with that famous plant called <hi>Maiz,</hi> and ſome other plants and roots, of which at the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> they commonly make their bread, as we in <hi>Europe</hi> doe of Wheat and other grain.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Maiz,</hi> the common bread corn of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> is a Plant, which groweth plentifully at
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170201:63"/>
the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> in moſt parts of the Continent, upon a moiſt and hot ground, as that generally is. It groweth upon a certain cane or reed of good bigneſs and about two cubits high from the ground: it groweth grape-wiſe, that is, the grain or fruit thereof, not covered nor incloſed in any husk or cod, as other grains of corn moſt commonly are, but open and in clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, onely fenced on each ſide with a large and broad leafe, growing upwards by it to the full height of the <hi>Maiz.</hi> The cluſter, or bunch of grains, is commonly a ſpan and half long, ſometimes more, rending ſharp up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the top in the faſhion of a Sugar-loaf, and of the bigneſs ordinarily of a mans arme; having upon the top of the cluſter a certain tuft or bunch of long hairy fillets, which, as the grain comes to maturity, doe likewiſe grow long, and bend downwards on one ſide of the bunch, not much unlike to the fore-top of Time and Opportunitie, as they commonly picture it. The grains of this <hi>Maiz</hi> are round, like unto peaſe, but bigger: yet commonly ſix or ſeven hundred of them are contained in one cluſter, and for the moſt part two or three cluſters upon every cane or reed. They are white till they come to be ripe, and then they turn outwardly black, but the flower of them,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170201:63"/>
or ſubſtance within, is ſtill as white as ſnow: and maketh a kinde of bread, for ſtrength or nouriſhment nothing inferiour to wheat. It naturally ingendreth much blood; ſo that ſtrangers not uſed to it, if they eate overmuch of it at firſt, are ſubject to ſwel upon it, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſcabbie, and obnoxious to ſuch other diſeaſes, as proceed of too much aboundance and heat of blood: but to ſuch as are uſed to it and eate it moderately, they ſay, it is a moſt agreeable kinde of food, eaſie of concoction, not at all obſtructive, as bread with us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of wheat or other grain, is generally held to be more or leſs, but rather in ſome degree purgative of noxious humors, and helpfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtone, and other oppilations of the body; with which infirmities the Indians, that continually feed upon this <hi>Maiz,</hi> both in bread and many other waies dreſſed, are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſeldom or never be troubled. The buds of it while they are green and tender, are of ſuch a fat and delicious ſubſtance, that they uſe them commonly inſtead of oyle and butter, being no leſs pleaſant and agreeable to the taſte. They make Wine of it alſo, or a drink not leſs ſtrong than Wine, and which, being freely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as quickly overcoms a man: which they make by ſteeping the grains of <hi>Maiz</hi> in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170201:64"/>
till it breaks, and afterwards boyling it, much after the manner as we make ordinarily our beer of Mault. There are diverſe ſorts of this <hi>Maiz,</hi> but that which is moſt commonly uſed for bread, is this already deſcribed. Their way of eating it, eſpecially with the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſort of People, is moſt commonly boyled in the grain hot, which they doe much after the manner that the People of <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan</hi> uſe in the boyling of their Rice, They have an earthen or ſome other ſort of Veſſel full of little holes at the bottom and round about the ſides below, into which having put ſo much of the grains of <hi>Maiz</hi> as they think fit, and ſtopt it up; they ſet it into another veſſel which they have full of water and already boyling on the fire; ſo as the water enters by little and little into the veſſel where the <hi>Maiz</hi> is, through the little holes: with which the <hi>Maiz</hi> preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beginneth to ſwel, and after a little boyling ſo ſtops the holes of the veſſel, that no more water can enter; and ſo boyling it on ſtill, it comes at laſt from a pulp or ſoft moiſty ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, to be more firm and hard, and ſuch as they uſe for bread. And when they eate it ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle or alone as bread, they count this the beſt way of eating it, <hi>viz.</hi> in the grain hot: but otherwiſe dreſſing it, as they oftentimes doe,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170201:64"/>
with oyle, butter, ſugar, and diverſe ſorts of Spice, they make many other pleaſant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious meats of it. This, as I ſaid, is the more common way of uſing it by the ordinary ſort of people; but the rich and better ſort grinde the <hi>Maiz,</hi> as we doe our wheat, and bake it, for the moſt part, into little cakes, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioned with ſugar and ſpices, as they uſe, doe make a very curious and dainty kinde of meat.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This is their <hi>Maiz,</hi> or the Indian wheat, as they call it. They have another kinde of bread at the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> called <hi>Caſſavi,</hi> made of a certain root which they call <hi>Jucca:</hi> it is a root of a large ſize and ſomewhat of a moiſt ſubſtance, the juyce whereof is held to be a kinde of poyſon, eſpecially to ſome perſons: for of others I read, that they have eate of the root green and full of juyce, though not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger, nor perhaps without coſting ſome of them their lives, as namely the Engliſh at <hi>Port-rico</hi> under the Earle of <hi>Cumberland:</hi> but the root of it, when it is well dryed, eſpecially if they uſe ſo much art with it, as to grinde it and work it into paſte, is made into a very good ſort of bread<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet more nouriſhing than toothſome. For the chief art which they uſe about it, is rather in the planting of the root
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170201:65"/>
than otherwiſe, of which the manner is thus. They raiſe a bed of earth in ſome luſty and good ſoile of about nine or ten foot ſquare every way, in which, at an equall diſtance, they ſet ten or twelve ſlips, as I may call them, or little branches, which grow naturally out of the ſame root, each of them about a foot long, on every ſide of the bed commonly three, and laid ſo aſlope within the ground, that the ends of them all doe almoſt meet together in the middle of the bed: Out of theſe after a certain time there ſprings a ſet of new roots, which grow commonly to the bigneſs and length of a mans arme, and ſometimes as big as a mans thigh; but this is onely when they let them lye a long time in the ground, <hi>viz.</hi> a year, or year and half: but then likewiſe they are ſaid to be beſt, and to make the moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and agreeable bread. By that time they are come to maturitie, the whole bed or plat of earth, on which they were planted, ſeems to to be all turned into roots. Then they take them out of the ground, and having ſcraped them a little on the outſide, they ſlice or cut them into ſmall pieces; which done, in a preſs made for that purpoſe, they ſtrain and force out all the juyce they can, juſt in the ſame manner as ſome Countrie folk ſtrain crabs, and preſs their
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170201:65"/>
cheeſe when they make it: and having by that means brought their <hi>Jucca</hi> into the faſhion of a broad cake, but ſomewhat thin, they lay it up for ſome time, till it be more throughly dryed, and then uſe it for bread without more trouble. 'Tis ſaid to have little or no taſte at all in the eating (and that's probable enough, by the ordering of it) but as for vertue and nouriſhment, wondrous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> good and wholſome; yet I remember <hi>Acoſta,</hi> who had taſted of it, ſayes plainly, he had rather eat a piece of the courſeſt and blackeſt bread he ever ſaw in his life. Neither doe they eate it, but firſt moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ſteeped in ſome water or warm broath: the reaſon whereof is the exceſſive dryneſs of the bread, which is ſuch that neither Wine, nor Milk, nor their <hi>Melaſſo,</hi> as they call it, which is the honey or ſweet juyce of the ſugar canes will pierce it; and therefore it keeps long, and they carrie it commonly to Sea inſtead of Bisket. By Land it is chiefly uſed in the <hi>Barlovente</hi> Iſlands, which are <hi>Hiſpaniola, Cuba, Jamaica, &amp;c.</hi> where there is not ſuch plenty either of Wheat or <hi>Maiz;</hi> not through any defect or barrenneſs of the ſoile, but as it is rather thought, from ſome indiſpoſition of the Aire and Climate; which is ſuch, that the very meal which they bring thither ſometimes
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170201:66"/>
from <hi>New Spain</hi> and from the <hi>Canaries,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts preſently ſuch a moiſtneſs, that they can hardly make any good bread of it; and that which they doe make will not keep, but in a few daies become moiſt and fluid again, and by conſequence apt to corrupt; which is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally attributed to the over-much humidity and heat of the Countrie.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. There is yet a third ſort of bread made at the Indies, which they call <hi>Chugno,</hi> and is made likewiſe of a certain ſmall root called <hi>Popa.</hi> This bread is uſed chiefly upon the <hi>Andes,</hi> and ſome parts of the <hi>Sierra</hi> or Hill-Countrie, and generally in all the colder parts and Provinces of <hi>America,</hi> where the root groweth plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and where, by reaſon of the cold, there is not ſo great plenty of Wheat or <hi>Maiz,</hi> nor yet perhaps of <hi>Caſſavi</hi> or <hi>Jucca;</hi> which, how dry ſoever it be, when they have reduc'd it to bread, yet naturally is of a groſs and juycie ſubſtance, luſcious, or at leaſt, not unpleaſing to the taſte, and requireth a warm and luſty ſoile. Theſe <hi>Popas</hi> are a kinde of ſmaller root, not unlike to the <hi>Bulbocaſtanum,</hi> or ground-Cheſnut, with many leaves growing out upon them: which they onely dry well in the Sun, and then grinde them; making a kinde of bread of them, which will keep long, and is probably
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170201:66"/>
of a good and ſtrong nouriſhment; for it is much uſed at the Mines of <hi>Potozi,</hi> where the labour is hard. They eate theſe roots alſo dreſſed otherwiſe, both boyled and baked, and account them a very good meat.</p>

                        <p>Of ſome choiſe and excellent Fruits, and Fruit-bearing Trees at the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THey have likewiſe plenty of Rice and Millet growing in <hi>America;</hi> but becauſe they uſe them not ſo generally for bread, and that they are not proper to the Countrie, but found as plentifully elſwhere, I ſhall paſs them over, and come to ſpeak of ſuch Fruits, Fruit-bearing trees, and others, as are peculiar to the <hi>New-world,</hi> and either not at all, or not ſo plentifully, or at leaſt not of ſuch perfection and excellency found any where elſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Amongſt the Fruits, and trees that bear Fruit, at the <hi>New World,</hi> the <hi>Platano,</hi> or Plane tree, I ſuppoſe, for many reſpects may deſerve the firſt place; not that it is the ſame tree which <hi>Pliny</hi> and the Ancients call the Plane, being
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170201:67"/>
neither ſo big (in any proportion) nor afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a ſhade as the Roman Plane is ſaid to doe; but onely for ſome reſemblance which it beareth towards it, and eſpecially in the largeneſs of its leaves, wherein the Plane at the Indies doth much exceed even that of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients. It groweth commonly two ſtades, or twice the height of a Man, from the ground, in a moiſt and wet ſoile, which it neceſſarily requireth, by reaſon that it makes a great ſtock, as they ſay, in the ground, that is, it caſteth a very large root every way round about its bulk or body: which it ſelf is not much above the bigneſs of a mans: out of which root, on all ſides their ſpring diverſe <hi>Siens</hi> or young <hi>Planes,</hi> round about the principal tree, every one apart by himſelf, and bearing fruit. The leaves of it are of a wonderfull bigneſs, of an ell broad, as ſome ſay, and above an ell and half long, hanging down to the ground, and ſufficient to cover an ordinary man of ſtature from head to foot. The Fruit is for the moſt part a ſpan long, and of the thickneſs of a Mans wriſt, ſomewhat bending in the middle, and groweth in cluſters commonly upon one bough, but that one ſo well laden, that it is ſaid to be no unuſual thing to gather two or three hundred Apples off that one bough. The
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170201:67"/>
Apple or Fruit of the <hi>Plane</hi> is at firſt green: but as it comes to ripeneſs, it turns yellow both within and without, and becomes a moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Fruit both for ſight and taſte; though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times they gather it green, and let it ripen in veſſels made for that purpoſe; but it is beſt and ſweeteſt, when it ripens upon the tree: The meat or ſubſtance of the Fruit within, when the rinde is taken off, is tender, very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and well nouriſhing, inclining never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs rather to cold than heat. The tree beareth fruit all the year long (as they ſay, 'tis uſuall at the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> for many or moſt Fruit-bearing trees to doe) and yet the ſame bough or ſtalk on which the fruit hangs, never beareth twice; but being cut away, another preſently ſprouteth in its room: ſo that there is a continuall ſucceſſion, as it were, of new ſprigs, young boughs, green fruit and ripe, ever following one another upon the principal ſtock. They are ſaid to have whole groves of this kinde of tree in many parts of <hi>America,</hi> the fruit whereof yeelds no little profit and revenue to the owners; it being a fruit where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Indians doe generally much delight, eating it commonly not onely raw, but likewiſe roaſted, boyled in pottage, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, conſerv'd, confectioned, and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170201:68"/>
other wayes, in all which it ſerveth very well.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The <hi>Coco</hi> is another excellent Fruit at the Indies. The tree which beareth it, is recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a kinde of Palme tree, not properly, but by reaſon of ſome reſemblance it hath in growth to the ordinary Palme. It grows much upon the Sea coaſt, upon a dry and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ground, yet alwaies hot: and 'tis ſaid then beſt of all to flouriſh, when 'tis planted neer to a Village, or ſome houſes, or by the way ſide, ſeeming, as it were to be delighted, and to thrive the better for the duſt and dirt, which in ſuch places it is beaten withall. The body of the tree is ſmooth and ſlender, being in no part bigger about than a mans middle, and growing ſtill more and more ſlender towards the top: nor doth it ever ſhoot forth a bough, ſprig, or leafe, but at the very top, which is uſually of the height of thirty or fourty foot at leaſt; But there it brancheth out into many ſmall boughs, in faſhion not unlike to an Oſtridges feather, thick ſet and not growing upward, but running out and ſpreading broad, as they grow, on all ſides of the tree or ſtock. Uunderneath, and, as it were, in the ſhade and coverture of which boughs, the <hi>Cocos,</hi> or <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker-nuts,</hi> as they call them (which are the fruit
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170201:68"/>
of the tree) doe grow in little cluſters, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times three or four of them together, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly out of the ſtem or ſtock of the tree, reaching according to the number and quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of them that grow, about a yard or more downward from the boughs. Every <hi>Coco</hi> or Nut is commonly as big as a mans head, of the faſhion of the leſſer ſort of Mellons, and of ſo hard a ſhel, that if one of them ſhould happen to light upon a mans head, falling from the tree (as commonly they doe fall when they are ripe) conſidering the height of the tree, he would have no great need of a Surgeon. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs the Fruit it ſelf is admirable and rare in many reſpects, and ſerves the Indians for a hundred uſes both of neceſſity and delight. Outwardly it is fenced with a green rinde or covering of a fibrous ſubſtance, full of many ſmall ſtrings or ſinews, like threds; which therefore, when it is dry, they card out into a kinde of hards or courſe Tow, and make cord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of it, ropes for their Canoa's and ſhips, Match; but moſt commonly they uſe it for the ſtopping up of the ribs of ſhips, and in leakes; to which purpoſe it ſerveth excellently well, by reaſon that if it be never ſo little moiſtened, it preſently ſwels, and by that means keeps out water better than any other ſtuff
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170201:69"/>
they can uſe. Next to this rinde or outmoſt covering, which is commonly two fingers thick, there is a hard ſhell which contains in it a certain liquid ſubſtance, very delicious and pleaſant, which while the fruit is green, is thin and cleer like water, but as white as milk, which they therefore drink both for the dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of the taſte, and to cool them in the heat; but when the fruit comes to be ripe, it grows more jelly and thick, and likewiſe more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant. The quantity of it is commonly a pint and half, or a quart, more or leſs according to the bigneſs of the <hi>Coco.</hi> Of this liquor, beſide that they drink it immediatly out of the fruit, as I have ſaid, according to ſeveral waies which they uſe it, they make both Oyle, Wine, Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and alſo milk of it; and ſerves reaſonably well in all. The liquor it ſelf drunk raw out of the fruit, is thought to be ſomewhat flatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and to breed crudities and other groſs humours in the body, if it ſhould be drunk over-much: nevertheleſs it procures urine aboundantly, and they ſay the Indians, who continually drink of it, are ſo little troubled with the ſtone or any other infirmities of the Reins, that they know not what they mean: and it yeeldeth ſuch plenty of this liquor, that one tree of theſe <hi>Cocos,</hi> if it thrives well, is
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170201:69"/>
thought ſufficient to ſupply a whole Family of no great number of perſons, with Wine, Oyle, and Milk of it ſelf alone. For every moneth it ſhoots forth new boughs and new <hi>Cocos,</hi> and 'tis not counted a good tree that beareth not fourty or fiftie <hi>Cocos,</hi> at leaſt, every moneth. In the midſt of this liquor lyeth the kernel of the Nut, or the principal meat of the <hi>Coco.</hi> This is a white and tender ſubſtance, in taſte much like unto Almonds, taking up all the reſt of the room in the <hi>Coco</hi>-ſhel, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining likewiſe in it another ſweet and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate liquor, which is held to be both comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and cordial. They have likewiſe another way to extract Wine out of the <hi>Coco;</hi> which is to cut the rinde and bark off the tree, but moſt eſpecially off the boughs and fruit, while it is green, from which preſently there iſſueth and drops a certain liquor no leſs pleaſant than Wine, which they receive into veſſels prepared for that purpoſe; which liquor they commonly alſo boyle, and make of it a kinde of Honey or Sugar, more eſteemed than that which is common.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. There is another kinde of this <hi>Coco,</hi> which groweth moſt upon the <hi>Andes,</hi> in bigneſs not much leſs than the other; but inſtead of the fat oylie ſubſtance in the middle of thoſe of the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170201:70"/>
firſt ſort, theſe are filled with an huge number of ſmall kernels or nuts, like to Almonds, or the graines of a Pomegranate admirably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted and laid together. Theſe kernels differ not much from Almonds in taſte, and are a meat reaſonably pleaſant, ſo as the Confectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners uſe them commonly for Marchpains and other banquetting Stuff, inſtead of Almonds; although of that kinde of fruit, <hi>viz.</hi> Almonds, they want not moſt excellent ones at the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> eſpecially thoſe of the Province of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copoyas</hi> in the Kingdome of <hi>Peru,</hi> which are ſaid to be the moſt pleaſing, delicate, and wholſome fruit in the World, of a more fat tender and delicous ſubſtance by far, than thoſe of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and for the moſt part much bigger.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Beſides theſe, there is at the <hi>New World</hi> another tree called <hi>Coca,</hi> which though it bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not any fruit that is much ſpoken of, yet by reaſon it hath ſome affinitie of name with the <hi>Coco,</hi> and is likewiſe a tree not a little eſteemed there, it requireth that we ſpeak ſomething of it. It is a tree that grows well onely upon hot and moiſt grounds, and not much above a fathom high from the ground; yet requiring good care and skil to husband it. It is in eſtimation onely for its broad leafe,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170201:70"/>
which it caſteth forth every fourth moneth new, to which leafe the Indians attribute I know not how many ſtrange vertues and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. This is certain and confirmed by dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experience, that it helpeth much againſt wearineſs of the bodie in any kinde of labour or travell, that it reviveth and exhilarates a mans ſpirits, ſeeming to infuſe new courage and ſtrength into him; inſomuch that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians will oftentimes goe three or four daies together about buſineſs with no other meat or victuals but a few leaves of this <hi>Coca</hi> cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in their mouthes. For which reaſon 'tis counted one of the chiefeſt Commodities at <hi>Potozi,</hi> not onely amongſt the Miners them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but generally with all other People; and they travel far to get it, <hi>viz.</hi> as far as the <hi>Andes,</hi> on the skirts whereof it chiefly groweth. They gather it with a great deale of care; and the leafe being very broad, they have great Baskets or Hampers made on purpoſe, into which they put it, and ſo lade their Mules or <hi>Pacos</hi> with it, and away for <hi>Potozi,</hi> where it is preſent Merchandiſe. They ſell it for the moſt part at three or four <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zos</hi> a Basket, and vend commonly one yeer with another four-ſcore or a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Basket sthere.</p>

                        <pb n="122" facs="tcp:170201:71"/>6. Another admirable tree there is at the Indies, called the <hi>Magney</hi> or <hi>Mete-tree;</hi> of which they report wonders, as namely that it yeeldeth them both Water, Wine, Oyle, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, Thred, Needles, and I know not how many other neceſſary things beſide; not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether untruly. The tree, according to the deſcription which <hi>Acoſta</hi> gives of it, is of a big body, and groweth commonly in the open fields, being of a moiſt and tender ſubſtance, hollow in the midſt: which therefore, when it is green, they uſe to cut; and at the places where they make inciſion, there iſſueth a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain liquor freſh and ſweet, which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly drink raw, as it iſſueth from the tree, gathering it in veſſels of gourds, <hi>Coco</hi>-ſhels, and others which they ſet there on purpoſe to receive it. This liquor, according as they ſeeth or boyle it more or leſs, becomes a Wine of a pleaſant good taſte, or Honey, or Sirup, or Vinegar, every one in their kinde good and wholſome. It beareth a large broad leafe, or rather, as ſome ſay, diverſe kindes of leaves; of which, while they are tender, they make rare and curious conſerves; but when they are grown out to their full bigneſs, being of a groſs fibrous ſubſtance, they draw out of it a kinde of thred like unto Hemp or Flax, which
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170201:71"/>
they afterwards ſpin and work into Mantles, Matts, Shoes, Girdles and many other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary things, and of the reſt make a ſort of courſe Paper: and of the point of the leafe, which is both hard and alſo very ſharp, they make Needles, that is, ſuch inſtruments to ſow withall as they had and uſed before the Spaniards came among them. The bark of the tree is both fat and very unctious; ſo that, being roaſted they make a ſalve of it, as 'tis ſaid, very good for hurts, bruiſes and old ſores; and from the boughs they gather a certain gum, which they likewiſe report to be a ſovereign Antidote againſt poyſons. The trees grow generally in all parts of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> but chiefly in the Countrie of <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>New Spain;</hi> wher there is ſcarſe an Indian to be found worth the houſe that he dwels in, but will be carefull to have ſome of theſe trees planted and growing about it, for the many neceſſarie ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies which it affordeth towards the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of a houſe and family.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. And in the Countrie of <hi>New Spain</hi> there likewiſe groweth another famous tree, called the <hi>Tuna</hi> or <hi>Tunall</hi> tree. It is originally from the root, nothing but a heap, as it were, of great broad leaves growing one out of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as well from the ground as upwards;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170201:72"/>
the leaves long and large, not ſharp or pointed, but round at the ends, and of the thickneſs of a mans thumb or finger: in which manner growing, it poſſeſſeth in time a good large ſpace of ground, and likewiſe grows upward into the faſhion and height of ſome ordinary tree. Its manner of growing is onely by new leaves ſprouting out at the ends of the old, and the old ones ſtill waxing bigger and bigger; ſo that at laſt it ſeemeth to have got a body and boughs, which is yet nothing elſe but the roots of the bigeſt and eldeſt leaves, now at length come to be hardned into a ſtock or trunk; the leaves themſelves being commonly thick ſet with certain long and ſharp prickles, of a whitiſh colour. There are two ſorts of them, the wilde, and the garden or planted <hi>Tunall;</hi> both of which beare a fruit, but very different one from the other, both for taſte and uſe. The garden or planted <hi>Tunall,</hi> bears a fruit well eſteemed with the Indians for meat, being ſomewhat bigger than ordinary plums, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many little grains lying in the pulp or ſubſtance of it, like figgs, of a white colour, good taſte, and no leſs pleaſant than figgs; and beſide that, of a delicate ſent or ſmell. The fruit of the wilde <hi>Tunall</hi> is green, growing (as alſo the other doth) out of the very top of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170201:72"/>
the leafe, in the faſhion of a fig, narrow below or towards the leafe, but upwards growing broad and round, and on the top invironed with a ſet of thick leaves in faſhion of a Crown or Coronet. The pulp of it, or ſubſtance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, is juycie and red, but neither pleaſing, nor any way commended for the taſte, as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve: in ſtains the hands of any that touch it with a deep red or ſanguine colour, like Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries; and which is more than that, the urine of thoſe that eate of it, will ſeem as if it were all turned into blood; inſomuch that ſome have been much frighted at their firſt eating thereof, and taken themſelves for dead men, finding their urine to be ſo ſtrangely changed, and not knowing the qualitie of the fruit. Within the Coronet, or circle of leaves, which grow upon the top of the fruit, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny little grains contained, which are the ſeed of the <hi>Tunall,</hi> and out of which, if they ſet them, there ſprings forth a Plant of the ſame kinde, round-bodied and not unlike to the trunck of other trees, when they firſt ſpring out of the ground, which preſently ſpreads it ſelf into leaves growing one out of another ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively, as the firſt did. This kinde of <hi>Tunall,</hi> as we ſaid, is not ſo much regarded for its fruit, but for another commoditie which comes of it,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170201:73"/>
of far greater profit and advantage than the fruit could be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were it much better than it is; <hi>viz.</hi> for the grain, called <hi>Cochinele,</hi> ſo famous and ſo much uſed by the Dyers for the dying of perfect Scarlets, or colours in grain, which is made of this tree in manner as followeth. Upon the leaves of the wilde <hi>Tunall</hi> there groweth uſually out certain tuberous or fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous excreſcencies, which, in time, turn into a kinde of Inſect, or Worme, and multiplyeth ſo much, that at laſt all the leaves of the tree, which, as it was ſaid, are very large, and as thick ordinarily as the thumb or finger of a mans hand, ſeem to be turned into a web of Worms, hanging and interwoven together by the <hi>fibrae,</hi> or little ſinews of the leaves. Theſe webs or verminated folio's of the <hi>Tunall,</hi> the Indians husband with a great deal of care and induſtrie, both while they are a breeding and afterwards, till they be well dryed; at which time making them up into boxes or little casks, they ſend them into <hi>Spain,</hi> and other parts of the World, as a great and rich Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe; which doubtleſs they are. For 'tis ſaid, they ſend commonly, one year with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, betwixt five and ſix thouſand <hi>Arrobes</hi> of <hi>Cochinele</hi> onely into <hi>Spain</hi> (every <hi>Arrobe</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining five and twenty pound weight at leaſt)
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170201:73"/>
which, according to the uſual rate they are ſold at, amounts to two hundred eighty three thouſand, ſeven hundred and fiftie <hi>Pezos</hi> by account.</p>

                           </gap>,</hi> or <hi>Hohi,</hi> as ſome call it; for though it be not a tree that beareth any excellent fruit (for the fruit it beareth is onely a ſmall yellow Plum, of the bigneſs of a Damoſin, and of little ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or meat, by reaſon of the greatneſs of the ſtone) yet becauſe it gives ſuch a propicious and healthy ſhade, as they ſay it doth, ſo as both Indians and Spaniards ſeek it out on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to reſt and ſleep under it, it deſerves, at leaſt, that I ſhould ſay what manner of tree it and where it grows. It is of bulk a fair and big tree, the boughs growing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> chiefly towards the top, thick and ſpreading; by reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as I ſaid, it yeelds as cool a ſhade as moſt trees at the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> doe; the bark or rinde whereof, being of a more tender and oylie ſubſtance, they boyl, and make a lavatory or bath of it, exceeding good and wholſome, eſpecially for the leggs, in caſe of any extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary weakneſs or wearineſs, from what cauſe ſoever proceeding. It groweth chiefly upon the Streit of <hi>Darien,</hi> but generally in all parts of <hi>Caſtella del oro,</hi> and not much elſewhere,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170201:74"/>
and, as they ſay, hath alwaies a good aire about it. If it be ſo, it ſeems given by God, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy and reliefe unto the poor people of thoſe hot Countries, who uſe much to lye abroad and ſleep in the fields, againſt the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which otherwiſe they might be ſubject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, by means of another tree, which (as <hi>Oviedo</hi> affirms, but nameth not) grows much in the ſame parts, of ſuch a peſtilent and contagious qualitie, that if a man reſt never ſo little under it, he ſhall be ſure preſently to feel ſome indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition in himſelf; and if he ſtayes or ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to ſleep under it, his head and face will ſwell, and his eye-lids in a ſhort time be cloſed up: yet is the tree, to look upon, fair and goodly, of a green flouriſhing colour, well branched and adorn'd with boughs and thick leaves on all ſides, and the fruit it ſelf ſo pleaſing both to the eye and taſte, that ſcarſe any man, eſpecially that is a ſtranger, but would be induced to taſte of it; which yet no man can doe without danger, it being of ſuch a noxious qualitie, that of it, together with ſome other ingredients the Indians of old time were wont to make the poyſon, wherewith they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venomed their arrows, ſo miſchievouſly, that 'tis ſaid, ſcarſe one man in fourty that happened to be wounded by them, eſcaped death.

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. I Should commit a great overſight, if in treating of the Commodities and Rarities of the <hi>New-World,</hi> I ſhould forget the <hi>Cacao;</hi> which, though it be but a ſmall fruit, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily not bigger than an Almond, and hardly of ſo good a taſte; yet becauſe it is ſo proper to the Countrie, ſo plentifully there growing, and likewiſe ſo much eſteemed and uſed as it is, almoſt in all kinde of bartery and traffique, I muſt not altogether omit it. It is a fruit, which with the Americans is almoſt every thing; it is both meat, drink, and money. It grows upon a ſmall tree of the bigneſs and faſhion of that of the Pome-citron, thriving
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170201:75"/>
beſt upon hot ground, yet in ſuch places where it is well ſhadowed from the Sun. There be ſeveral kindes of them; and by the deſcription which <hi>Hernandez,</hi> or rather <hi>Antonius Recchius,</hi> makes of the <hi>Cacao,</hi> in his general Hiſtorie of American Plants, printed at <hi>Rome</hi> 1651. it ſeems that <hi>Herrera, Acoſta,</hi> and others are not ſo exact in their report of this fruit, who gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally deſcribe it as a fruit ſomewhat leſs than an Almond, whereas <hi>Hernandez,</hi> a Doctor of Phyſick, and one who lived many yeers in thoſe parts, by command of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> on purpoſe to obſerve the Natures of ſuch Plants and Phyſical rarities as <hi>America</hi> afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, makes ſome kindes of <hi>Cacao</hi> to be as big as a good Mellon or Pompion, and none leſs than the greateſt ſort of Apples. To reconcile them I ſuppoſe we muſt ſay, that what <hi>Acoſta, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rera,</hi> and others call the <hi>Cacao,</hi> is but the ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of that <hi>Cacao</hi> which <hi>Hernandez</hi> deſcribeth; and that there grow many of theſe leſſer <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caos</hi> together, in one common husk, rinde, or ſhell: which <hi>Hernandez</hi> likewiſe intimates when he ſayes the <hi>Cacao</hi> contains within it <hi>diverſe ſmall parts cloſe compacted together,</hi> and afterwards calls that <hi>the ſeed,</hi> or kernel, <hi>of Cacao,</hi> which the Americans uſe inſtead of money, and whereof they make drink, which
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170201:75"/>
is the very <hi>Cacao</hi> that <hi>Acoſta</hi> and others onely mention, without taking notice of any other. It is a fruit of a tender and fat ſubſtance, of good nouriſhment, eſpecially roaſted, boyled, or any other way dreſſed: raw, or eaten out of the fruit onely, it cauſeth, as ſome ſay, oppi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and obſtructions of the ſtomach. Yet the Indian women love it extreamly, and think themſelves never well but when they are ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the skin or film of it, which is commonly a white juycie ſubſtance, but ſometimes red or Murrey, which they finde to be very cooling to them in thoſe hotter Climates, and have an opinion alſo that it makes them fair. It is a fruit that laſteth long, and impaireth not much by age; in reſpect whereof, and that it is ſo generally eſteemed there, the Indians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſe it inſtead of money, as hath been ſaid, buying, or having in exchange for <hi>Cacao</hi> almoſt every thing in the Market. But the chief reaſon of its ſo general eſteem and uſe at the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> is, a certain drink they make of it, called <hi>Chocolatte;</hi> which, becauſe it is a liquor that the Americans extreamly love, and that it begins likewiſe to be cryed up in ſome parts of <hi>Europe</hi> for an excellent drink (though all men give not the ſame report of it) I ſhall relate, as briefly as I can, how they make it, from
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170201:76"/>
the report of a late traveller in thoſe parts.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They take a certain quantity of <hi>Cacao</hi> nuts or almonds, as we call them; which, having well dryed, they pound them w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ſom cods of <hi>Chili,</hi> or long red Pepper of <hi>America,</hi> a handfull of Anniſeed, ſome quantity of Cinnamon, Cloves, and likewiſe of white Sugar, till they have brought them all into a ſoft powder, or paſte, which they put up into boxes or tablets of what quantitie and bigneſs they pleaſe, laying it firſt upon paper within the box, from which, upon occaſion, the powder or paſte will eaſily ſeparate; but to any thing that is of earth or wood it ſticks faſt. They put to it likewiſe certain grains of <hi>Achiotte,</hi> which is another fruit of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> growing much after the manner of <hi>Cacao, viz.</hi> many grains of it together in one husk or cod, all of them red. This is onely to give the <hi>Cacao</hi> a good colour; and the <hi>Achiotte</hi> is commonly pounded by it ſelf, and ſold in boxes, or little round cakes, yet ſo fine and dry, that it will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily mix and incorporate it ſelf with the <hi>Cacao,</hi> to give it tincture. The better ſort, and they that mean to make the <hi>Chocolatte</hi> rich and very pleaſing, add many other ingredients; but theſe already mentioned are the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſed; and the <hi>Cacao</hi> thus made up, they
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170201:76"/>
ſell uſually at four ſhillings a pound. This is <hi>Chocolatte,</hi> or the confectioned <hi>Cacao.</hi> And as there is difference in the compoſition of it, ſo likewiſe they drink it diverſe waies. The richeſt is that which is uſed by the Gallants and Ladies at <hi>Mexico, viz.</hi> to drink hot with <hi>Atolle,</hi> after this manner. They diſſolve a box or tablet of <hi>Cacao</hi> in ſome little quantity of pure hot water, ſtanding on the fire; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt with a Molinet, or ſome other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, ſtirred it up, and well mixed the <hi>Cacao</hi> and water together, they put ſo much of <hi>Atolle</hi> into it, as fills up the Cup or veſſell, and ſo drink it by ſuppings very hot. This <hi>Atolle</hi> is it ſelf a rich and delicious liquor, of which I ſhall ſpeak by and by. But the moſt uſual way of drinking it is, to diſſolve a box or Tablet of <hi>Cacao</hi> in hot water, and having well ſweetned it with Sugar, to drink it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more adoe, onely with ſome conſerves, or Naples-Bisket, either dry or ſteeped in the <hi>Chocolatte,</hi> as every one pleaſe. Sometimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo they diſſolve it in cold water, and ſtir it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually with a Molinet, til it riſe to a ſcum, or froth, which they take off, and put into ſome other veſſel or cup, and make the other hot; which when they have likewiſe ſweetned with Sugar, they poure out into the veſſel,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170201:77"/>
where the ſcum or froth is that was firſt taken off, and ſo drink them both together. But this way is not held to be ſo good, as cauſing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſructions and windineſs in the ſtomach: whereas the effects of <hi>Chocolatte</hi> well tempered and moderately taken, are ſaid to be, that it fortifyeth and comforts the ſtomach; which at the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> in many perſons, is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſubject to a <hi>Cachexia,</hi> or fainting ſome hours after meale, whether it be from any peculiar indiſpoſition of the Aire or Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, or from ſom natural weaknes and inſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity in the food or dyet of the Countrie; which though it be for the moſt part luſcious tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and pleaſing in the palate, in what kinde ſoever it be, whether of fleſh, fiſh or fruits, yet is it not held to be of ſo ſtrong and ſolid nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the dyet of <hi>Europe</hi> generally is. It is ſaid likewiſe to revive and exhilerate the ſpirits very much, to help concoction, to make luſty and corpulent, and may be well taken three times a day, in the morning, a little before dinner, and ſome three or four hours after, but very moderately, and never exceeding one reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble draught at a time: and a if man hath occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to watch, or ſit up late, it will help him very much to take one cup of it more about eight or nine a clock at night.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="135" facs="tcp:170201:77"/>3. Now as for <hi>Atolle,</hi> of which I ſpake even now, it is a drink of it ſelf very delicious, made of the juyce of the young <hi>Maiz,</hi> or Indian Wheat, much like unto Almond milke, but ſomwhat thicker, and ſo confectioned with Sugar, Spices, Musk and other ingredients of the Countrie, that it is not onely of Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſweetneſs, both for the taſte and ſmell, but much more nutritive and comfortable to the ſtomach; and would doubtleſs be accounted a rare dtink in <hi>Europe,</hi> if it would endure the Sea, or could be tranſported thence, but that it will not: whereas <hi>Chocolatte,</hi> or <hi>Cacao,</hi> made up in boxes, as we ſaid, is ſent abroad into <hi>Spain, Flanders, Italy,</hi> and many other parts of the World. The Commoner ſort of Indians have another kinde of drink, which they call <hi>Chica,</hi> a helliſh ſlap, and ſuch, as if it had but ſome good quantity of Hen-bane ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Toade, which they commonly put into it, and ſteep him there till he be dead and quite conſumed, would be a draught fitter for the Devill than a Chriſtian. They take a great Jarre or veſſel of the ſort of thoſe which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they have from <hi>Spain,</hi> and put in ſome certain quantity of water, filling up the reſt with <hi>Melaſſos,</hi> or the juyce of Sugar Canes, and ſometimes a little Honey: And beſide
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170201:78"/>
theſe, to give it a ſtrength agreeable to their Palats that drink it, they put in good ſtore of the roots and leaves of Tobacco, and of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall other roots of the Countrie, of ſtrong and violent operation, adding to all, the biggeſt and blackeſt toad they can finde: and having ſo done, they cloſe up the Jarre, and let it ſtand for the ſpace of three weeks or a moneth, till all the ingredients be throughly ſteeped and conſumed; after which, they drink it. And though, for the moſt part, at the firſt opening of the Jarre, it gives a ſent that a ſtranger hath much adoe to indure, yet the Indians love it and drink it exceſſively, having many great meetings onely to drink <hi>Chica;</hi> and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they carowſe ſo long at it, that they are all of them not onely drunk, which is uſual with them, but even raging mad with it; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the Spaniſh Officers and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates among them labor what they can to prohibit ſuch meetings, but all in vain; cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome and the naturall inclination of the Americans to drink and ſwill very much, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto prevailing againſt their endeavors. I am not ignorant that ſome Authors give a better character of a certain drink at the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> under the name of <hi>Chica;</hi> nor can I ſay which of them it is, that hath miſtaken the name: This
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170201:78"/>
I am ſure, the Author whom I follow, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be an eye witneſs, and to have ſeen with his eyes that which he reports of the thing it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> the quality of the drink, and manner of drinking it by the Indians: which in truth ſeems to me to be but a relique of their old barbarity and ſavageneſs; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall ſpeak no more of it.</p>

We have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the Cattel of <hi>Europe,</hi> which have been tranſported thither, have thriven aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, and multiplyed into ſuch incredible numbers, as well Kine or great Cattle, as thoſe of the leſſer ſort, <hi>viz.</hi> Sheep, Hoggs, Goats, &amp;c. that Swine, and alſo great Cattel in the Iſlands, eſpecially of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> and in many parts of the Continent beſide, live wilde in heards upon the Mountains, and may be killed by any body that will take the pains to doe it. Yea, they ſay that the very doggs which the Spaniards carried over, and which did them not a little ſervice, when time was, againſt the naked Indians, have multiplyed ſo exceedingly, that they goe alſo in companies, like other wilde Beaſts, up and down the Countrie, and are one of the greateſt inconveniencies to w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the Countrie of <hi>America</hi> is ſubject, for the miſchief that they doe to their Sheep and other ſmall Cattel, being become almoſt as ravenous and bad as ſo many Wolves, and ſeem to be little leſs than metamorphiz'd into Wolves,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170201:79"/>
by their wild and mountainous breeding, and by reaſon of a ſtrange fierceneſs which they have contracted by ſuch breeding and living. So as the Spaniards that brought them thither, are forced to keep guard, and to maintain, as it were, a <hi>defenſive warre</hi> againſt their own Creatures. Nevertheleſs in the moſt inland Countries of <hi>America,</hi> where the Spaniards live and many hundreds of leagues from the Sea, or any part of the Iſlands, there is ſo great plenty of fleſh-meat, that for a Ryall of plate, which is but ſix pence Engliſh money, a man may buy thirteen or fourteen pound weight of the beſt Beef, Mutton, or Pork, in the Market, of an <hi>Obligado</hi> (as they call him) or ſome of his Deputies, who are men appointed and bound, as we ſaid before, to ſerve ſuch a Citie, Town, or Place, with fleſh meat, at a certain rate, all the year long. So that omitting to ſpeak any thing more concerning forein or European Cattel at the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> I ſhall ſpeak onely, and that very briefly, of ſuch Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and other Creatures, as are more proper to the <hi>New World,</hi> ſeem either moſt worthy, or moſt neceſſary to be known by us; beginning firſt with thoſe of the Land.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And among the Land Creatures of <hi>America,</hi> I ſuppoſe the <hi>Pacos,</hi> or Peruvian
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170201:80"/>
Sheep, as they commonly count and call them, may by right come in the firſt place, being the moſt profitable Cattel of the Countrie, I had almoſt ſaid, of the World, affording the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians both meat, clothing, and ſervice. It is a Beaſt of a reaſonable good ſtature, bigger than a Calfe, and ſomewhat leſs than a Bullock of two year old, and bears a burthen, for the moſt part, of 150 pound weight, without the charge either of ſaddle or ſhooing, as both Horſe and Mules require, feeding onely upon ſuch meat as they finde upon the roade; and in caſe they finde none, travelling ſome dayes without either meat or water. There are two ſorts of theſe <hi>Pacos;</hi> one that bears a good fleece of wooll; the other ſmooth and bare, yet ſomewhat the ſtronger of the two for bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. They have long necks like a Camel, and are of diverſe colours, white, black, grey, and ſpotted. Their fleſh is likewiſe very good meat, eſpecially while they are young, and of their young ones, which is ſaid to be the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt and moſt delicate that can be eaten, though they kill not many of them by reaſon of their neceſſary ſervice, and ſo great plenty of other meat. But of their wooll they make ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts of cloath; one more groſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: the other very fine, which they call
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170201:80"/>
                        <hi>Cumbi;</hi> and ſerveth for Carpets, Coverings, and many other uſes, laſting long, and having, a good luſtre, and (which is ſomewhat more curious) woven on both ſides alike, without difference. They drive theſe <hi>Pacos</hi> in troops, ſometimes four or five hundred of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or more, laden with Merchandiſe, Wine, <hi>Maiz, Coca,</hi> Quick-ſilver, and Silver in Barrs, which they carrie from the Mines of <hi>Potozi,</hi> as far as <hi>Ariqua,</hi> upon the South-Sea, which is about threeſcore or ſeventy leagues, without any other Convoy or Guide, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a few Indians to drive the Sheep, and ſome Spaniards to overſee the Indians. They indure froſt and cold naturally, as having been bred, and thriving beſt upon the <hi>Sierra</hi> and <hi>Andes</hi> of <hi>Peru;</hi> where they are ſeen many times covered with ice and ſnow, yet never ſhrinking at it; whereas in the Planes and hot Countrie they dye. They are in truth a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſerviceable and good Creature, yet not without ſome odd qualities, which the Reader, muſt know, eſpecially that ſort of them which are ſmooth and bear no fleece. If they meet a ſtranger by the way, they will many times ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſtand ſtill, and raiſing up their long necks as high as they can, ſtare and gaze upon him ſo wiſtly, as will make a man laugh not a little to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170201:81"/>
ſee it, and with ſuch a confidence as if he feared nothing; yet all on the ſudden a fright takes him, and away he runs with his load upon his back, and commonly ſo faſt that his driver is hardly able to recover him before he hath gained ſome high rock or Mountain, where the Indian either cannot or dare not follow him for the precipice; and from hence nothing will command him but a Harquebuz, which they are oftentimes forced to uſe, onely to get the Silver again, that is upon his back. They have likewiſe another quality not a little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome; which is to grow reſty, and lye down under their burthens: though this be but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and, as they ſay, never but when they are laden or driven beyond ordinary. But if the fit once take him, there is no other remedy but to have patience to ſit down by him, make on him, and let him take his own time to riſe; which, after a while, he will doe of himſelf: but to ſtir or ſtrive with him before, is to no purpoſe; for though you beat him never ſo much, or kill him, or cut him in a thouſand peeces, all will not make him move a foot: but by bearing him company, and treating him fairely, after two or three hours reſt he will riſe and goe on his journey as willingly as can be. They are commonly eſtimated at five or
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170201:81"/>
ſix peeces of <hi>Aſſay,</hi> which may be about four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhillings Engliſh money; and at the Indies he that hath but four or five of theſe <hi>Pacos</hi> to travel withall &amp; carrie Merchandiſe from place to place, will not count himſelf a poor man.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The <hi>Vicugnes</hi> are a kinde of wilde Goats, but much bigger than the ordinary Goats of <hi>Europe,</hi> and without hornes, otherwiſe coated and haired like Goats. They live wilde on the mountainous parts of <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Chile,</hi> being in other parts not ſo common; and for the moſt part upon the tops of thoſe higheſt moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the <hi>Andes,</hi> nothing offended with the ſharpneſs of the cold or ſnow. They goe commonly in heards or great companies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, being exceeding fearfull Creatures, and withall very light of foot. Anciently the hunting of them was forbidden to the common People, and reſerved onely to the <hi>Inguas</hi> and Lords of <hi>Peru:</hi> now 'tis generally uſed, whenſoever they are found in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands. They are of a dark brown colour, not much unlike to dryed Roſes, &amp; bear a fleece of a long ſhaggie haire, yet ſo fine that the Indians make rugs and coverings of it, of great value. Their fleſh is counted the moſt dainty ſort of Veniſon, and in ſome caſes medicinal: yea the Indians have an opinion that the very Quilts
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170201:82"/>
and Coverings made of the wooll or haire of the <hi>Vicugnes,</hi> are good againſt the inflammation of the reins, and for the tempering of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive heat; nor is it improbable. For conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what kinde of Paſturage this beaſt doth naturally delight in, and for the moſt part live by, which is more than half froſt and ſnow, it may well be thought, that not only their fleſh, but every thing elſe that proceeds naturally of their ſubſtance, ſhould in ſome degree be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigerative, and retain ſome cooling vertue in it. Of the fleſh there is no diſpute to be made, but that it is very ſoveraign and good in all ſuch caſes, <hi>viz.</hi> of inflammations and immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heat. <hi>Acoſta</hi> gives a notable inſtance of it in himſelf; who having travelled ſo long upon the <hi>Andes</hi> and thoſe cold mountains of <hi>Peru,</hi> that his eyes were inflamed with the exceſſive ſharpneſs of the Aire, and become ſo painfull to him, that they ſeemed ready to drop out of his head, onely by rubbing them lightly with a piece of the raw fleſh of the <hi>Vicugne,</hi> the pain was preſently aſſwaged, and his eyes in ſhort time reduced to good temper. Nor is this the onely good they have by this Beaſt; for out of his ſtomach, when he is kild, they take likewiſe the Bezar ſtone, true and good, and ſcarſe any way inferiour to that of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi>
                        <pb n="145" facs="tcp:170201:82"/>
which, as 'tis well known, is a ſtone of rare vertue, eſpecially in way of Antidote againſt any ſorts of poiſon, in all peſtilential Diſeaſes, and likewiſe the infirmities of deep Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. They finde it commonly of the bigneſs of a wallnut; ſometimes of an Hens egge, or an Orange; but theſe are rare.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. There is alſo at the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> another Beaſt, which they call <hi>Tarugne,</hi> not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to the <hi>Vicugne;</hi> but bigger of body, and likewiſe of a ſwifter pace. Theſe live not in companies, as the <hi>Vicugnes</hi> doe, but ſolitary and ſingle, and carrie their eares hanging down, whereas thoſe of the <hi>Vicugne</hi> are erect and ſtand up: in other reſpects they much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the <hi>Vicugne,</hi> yeelding likewiſe the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar ſtone, as the <hi>Vicugne</hi> doth; and which, though it be not altogether ſo big, yet is thought to be much better in vertue and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration than the other. There are Bezar ſtones likewiſe taken very often out of the <hi>Pacos;</hi> but thoſe are leſs, not ordinarily above the bigneſs of an haſell nut, or Filberd; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo perfect and true in kinde, or no, as the other, I cannot ſay. The <hi>Taurus Mexica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> as ſome Authors call him, and we muſt Engliſh, the <hi>American Bull,</hi> or <hi>Steere,</hi> is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrange Beaſt at the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> ſtrange
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170201:83"/>
I call them in reſpect of our ſelves, and theſe parts of the World; for otherwiſe they are no way ſtrange, being common at <hi>America,</hi> eſpecially in the more Northern parts of it, and of no very monſtrous or deformed ſhape. They reſemble the Oxe of <hi>Europe</hi> only a little in the head, and not otherwiſe; being not only of a far leſs ſize than the ordinary Oxe or Bullock, but alſo of a ſtature ſomewhat with the loweſt, even in proportion to their own bulke; having a good big full bodie, of the ſize of ſome leſſer ſort of Cows, but very ſhort leggs to bear it; yet we may well count them the natural and proper Kine of <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi> They are of a bright brown colour, or if you pleaſe, of a dark yellow, ſuch as the Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans call <hi>il colore lionato,</hi> having a thick long hair curled all over their bodie, which at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance makes them appear ſomewhat terrible and horrid, but coming neerer them, their countenance ſeems rather cheerful and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; neither have they any truculency or fierceneſs of condition, but are as tractable and eaſily maniable as other Cattel. On their backs they have a little riſing or bunch, like a Camel, though I doe not obſerve that they are any where uſed for burthen, like the Camel. They breed and abound moſt in the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170201:83"/>
Province of <hi>Quivira,</hi> which is a plain level Countrie in the Northern part of <hi>America,</hi> affording little elſe but paſturage; and from hence they are had into other parts, being the cheif wealth of this Countrie, and ſubſiſtance of the People; who chiefly live upon this Cattel, feeding huge multitudes of them in Heards up and down the Countrie, as their paſture leads them, uſing their fleſh for meat, which is very good, and making a drink of their blood.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Yet is their another ſort of ſmal Cattel rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned for Kine at the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> which they call <hi>Dantes,</hi> but in their figure and ſhape more reſembling Mules than Kine; neither have they any horns. The hides of theſe Beaſts are much uſed by the Indians for Jerkins, or a kinde of upper Garment, which is as good as ſome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor for them, it being ſo thick and hard, as it is ſaid to reſiſt any weapon that the Indians uſe: like to the <hi>Armadillos</hi> (as the Spaniards call them) which are likewiſe another kinde of Beaſts proper to the <hi>New World,</hi> much leſſer than the <hi>Dantes,</hi> yet covered all over the body, as it were, with a Coat of Maile, that is, with a ſcalie hard skin, which ſhe opens and ſhuts at pleaſure, and thereby both covers and defends her ſelf upon occaſion. The fleſh of this Beaſt
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170201:84"/>
is eaten by ſome, but not ſo generally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for good meat. The <hi>Saynos</hi> are a kinde of Hogge or Swine of <hi>America,</hi> a wilde and fierce Creature, and in this reſpect ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more ſtrange, that their Navil is ſaid to be on the midſt of their back. They are armed likewiſe on their feet with talons, ſo ſharp that a Raſor will not pierce faſter or further then they, and with them they doe uſually teare and wound ſuch as purſue them, very dangerouſly, eſpecially if they have not good care and skil in hunting them. The fleſh of them, when they are taken, is counted good meat; but to keep it, the Navil in the back of it muſt be taken quickly out, otherwiſe it will pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifie in a few dayes. The <hi>Chincelles</hi> are a kinde of Squirrel, of a wonderfull ſoft and ſmooth hair, the skin whereof is thought to be very comfortable to the ſtomach in any ſudden pain or fainting, and affordeth a delicate kinde of Furre, much uſed and eſteemed by the better ſort. The <hi>Viſcachas</hi> and <hi>Cuyos</hi> are the Hares and Conies of <hi>America,</hi> of much bigger ſize than theſe of <hi>Europe,</hi> and are hunted there likewiſe for ſport, as here, and their fleſh counted not the worſt ſort of Veniſon. The <hi>Micos,</hi> or Monkies of <hi>America,</hi> are many and of ſeveral kindes; ſome whereof are ſaid
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170201:84"/>
not to be much leſs than the body of a little man, and alſo bearded under their chaps as venerably as any Goat. They deſcribe a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain kinde of them in <hi>Peru</hi> with long tailes, and commonly of thrice the bigneſs of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie Ape, of diverſe colours, <hi>viz.</hi> black, grey, bay, and ſpotted; and report many pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtories of them; which, if true, argue them to be extreamly ingenious, and to have, at leaſt, ſome <hi>traites de viſage,</hi> as they ſay, or reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances of reaſon. This is common with them; when they have minde to any fruit upon a tree, they get preſently up, and winding their taile about the bough, with the weight of their bodie ſhake as much fruit off it as they think fit. Of another it is ſaid, that ſeeing a Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er level at him with his Musket, he ſnatch't up a ſtone, and before the Musket could be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, threw it at him and hit him full in the eye. <hi>Acoſta</hi> tells of another, which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſent to the Tavern for wine, the pot in one hand and money in the other; which er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand he would perform moſt exactly, and with ſuch diſcretion, that they muſt be very rude with him, that ſhould get the money out of the one hand, before his pot were filled and put into the other. The Boys in the ſtreet would throw ſtones at him many times in
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170201:85"/>
ſport, and he at them again, but never till he had firſt ſet down his pot; then he would lay about him with any thing next hand; nor would he offer to take up his pot again, till they ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be quiet, and that his way was cleer: and if they gave it him, he would drink wine freely; but otherwiſe not ſo much as touch it. There be alſo Lyons, Bears, Tygres, and other wilde Beaſts of prey at the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> but neither ſo great, nor ſo ravenous as thoſe in other parts of the World. The Lyons in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> are rather grey than red or yellow, and have not that long ſhaggie haire on the fore-parts of their bodie, with which they are paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Tygres are more fierce and cruel; but that is only when they are hungry, and ſeek their prey: for otherwiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> when their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are full, if the report of <hi>Maffaeus</hi> be true in his <hi>hiſtoria Indica,</hi> they are as fluggiſh and heavie a Beaſt as any, and may be both taken and killed by any body almoſt that will: But by his favour I will not be the firſt that ſhall make tryal. There is likewiſe aboundance of Staggs and wild Deer in all parts of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent of <hi>America;</hi> but, for ought I know, in the Iſlands there are none found.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Theſe are all Beaſts and Creatures of the Land, with which, and infinite others, not
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170201:85"/>
here to be mentioned, the <hi>New World</hi> is aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſtored: Nor doe the Waters afford leſs variety, either of Sea, or more within Land, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Lakes and Rivers, which are generally ſo plentifully and well ſtored with good fiſh, that there is no Countrie in the World comparable to <hi>America</hi> in that reſpect. Amongſt theſe the <hi>Cayman,</hi> as they call him, or Indian Crocodile, as the moſt prodigious and ſtrange, deſerves to be firſt mentioned: yet is he an amphibious Creature, living as well, and perhaps as much upon Land as in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It is a moſt fierce and ravenous Creature, of a vaſt bulk or bigneſs, being ſaid to be from the fore part of his ſnout to the end of his tayle ſeven or eight yards long; and of ſuch ſtrength, that he hath been ſeen to take up a living man, lying aſleep upon the ſhore, in his mouth, and to carry him cleer away with him into the water, over to another Iſland or Rock in the Sea, where he meant to have devoured him: But being ſhot with a Caliver he loſt his prey, and the man was recovered, but dyed ſoon after. He ſeeks his prey commonly upon Land, which he kills or drowns in the Water: yet cannot there eat it, by reaſon of ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar diſpoſition of his throat or gullet, which is ſuch, as that it permits him not to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170201:86"/>
any thing in the water, but with hazard to ſuffocate or drown himſelf. The beſt is, his motion by Land is but ſlow, and his body ſo unweldy, that he cannot turn himſelf but with much adoe, nor his head to either ſide without turning his whole body. Yet doe they much miſchief, eſpecially about ſome Rivers in the Provinces of <hi>Mechoacan</hi> and <hi>Tlaſcalla,</hi> where there are many of them. They ſay 'tis excellent ſport to ſee a <hi>Cayman</hi> and a Tygre fight, as they happen to doe oftentimes, endeavouring to prey one upon another. The <hi>Cayman,</hi> with his taile, cruelly beats and jerks the Tygre, endeavouring what he can to hale him into the water. The Tygre as ſtoutly reſiſts him with his paw, and labours to pull up the <hi>Cayman</hi> to land; which for the moſt part he doth, and then opens him by the belly, which is the only part of him where he can be pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; his whole body otherwiſe being armed with ſcales ſo extremely hard and thick ſet, that no Lance, and ſcarcely an Harquebuz or Musket ſhot will enter it. The Indians fear him not ſo much by water as land: for being themſelves excellent Swimmers and Dyvers, and the <hi>Cayman</hi> alwaies ſwimming above water, or very fleet, they make no great matter to encounter him hand to hand in his own
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170201:86"/>
element for they eaſily get under his belly, and with their knives or ſhort Lances pierce him there as they liſt, and ſo bring him to Land.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The <hi>Tyburons</hi> are a kinde of Shark-fiſh, of large ſize, and extremely ravenous. They are commonly ten or twelve foot long, and about ſix or ſeven ſpans broad on the back, being faſhioned like a Soale, with huge wide mouths, and two rows of teeth on each ſide of their mouth very ſharp and thick ſet, and of ſo great ſtrength, that at one ſnatch or jerk, they will break the bones or pluck aſunder the joints of any Beaſt whatſoever: They follow the ſhips at Sea willingly, for the waſh and other ſtuff which the Mariners caſt out to them, being ſo ravenous that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive everything. <hi>Acoſta</hi> reporteth, that out of the gullet of one of them, he ſaw taken at the ſame time a great Butchers knife, a long iron hook, and a piece of a Cows head, with one horn ſtill growing upon it. Others tell of Hats, whole Shirts, Leggs and Arms of Men, ropes ends, with many other things of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture found in the ſame manner. Yet is the fleſh of them counted very good meat, when they are well dryed, and a principall reliefe in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occaſions at Sea; where they are taken without much difficultie, and ſo bigge, that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170201:87"/>
many times ten or twelve men have ſomewhat to doe to pull one of them up, when they have him upon the hook. They come likewiſe out of the Sea up into the rivers, as the <hi>Caymans</hi> doe, and are exceeding dangerous both to men and cattell, that are not aware of them, or happen to ly or ſleep upon the banks of any great river, as in <hi>America</hi> it is not unuſuall to doe. At Sea they are commonly attended by a ſmaller ſort of fiſh which they call <hi>Rambos,</hi> which lives by the meat that falls from the <hi>Tyburon,</hi> as the <hi>Jaccall</hi> is ſaid to doe by the Lion.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The <hi>Manati,</hi> or <hi>Oxe-fiſh,</hi> as ſome call them, is another great fiſh of the Sea, bigger by farre than the <hi>Tyburon,</hi> headed like an Oxe or young heifer, with two armes, or at leaſt ſtumpes of armes on each ſide before, and thoſe as ſome ſay, diſtinguiſhed into ſeverall joynts with nailes upon them, not unlike to thoſe of a mans hand. This is a gentle and harmeleſs creature, and though of bulk or body not leſs than a young Oxe or Bullock, yet neither of any feirce or horrid aſpect, but rather amiable and cleerer countenanced, as the figure of it in <hi>Hernandez,</hi> and <hi>Laet</hi> ſheweth. It cometh fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently upon land, and feeds upon hearbs or graſſe, if there be any neer; and being at Sea it ſwimes commonly above water and is eaſily
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170201:87"/>
taken. 'Tis counted for meat the beſt fiſh in the World, being as tender and delicate as any veale, or the beſt young porke; and ſo like it, that a ſtranger would verily take it for veale, which it reſembles ſo much every way, both for colour and taſte, that it hath been diſputed and queſtioned by ſome whither it might be eaten on faſting dayes; for that it both eateth hearbs and graſſe, reſembles fleſh ſo much, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth its young alive, ſuckling them with milk by certain teats which they have, as other Land creatures doe. They finde in the head of it a certain Stone, or hard congelated Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which being ground to powder, they ſay is very good for the ſtone in the reins, and to provoke urine, eſpecially that which is found in the male-fiſh.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The <hi>Tortoiſe</hi> is a Fiſh yet greater than any of theſe before ſpoken of, <hi>viz.</hi> than the <hi>Tybu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> or the <hi>Manati,</hi> and upon the Shores of the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> every where, there are great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of them found. Theſe are a Shell-fiſh of figure and ſhape round, carrying their houſe or cover, alwayes upon their back, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence moving but ſlowly. They take them ſometimes at Sea with Nets made for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe only, but moſt commonly on the Shore, whither they frequently reſort in huge multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170201:88"/>
cheifly to lay their egges, which in the ſand are hatched with incredible increaſe, onely by the heat of the Sun: and though they make all the haſte they can to Sea again, aſſoon as ever they perceive any body, yet they are eaſily overtaken, and by turning them with a ſtaffe or pole, upon their backs, which is not hard for them to doe that are acquainted with the manner of hunting <hi>Tortoiſes;</hi> two or three men will ſtay and take a whole company of them. They are commonly a yard and a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at leaſt in length, and ſometime more than twice ſo much in breadth, and of ſuch bigneſs &amp; weight, that it will ordinarily require ſix or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſtout men to draw one of them out of the water; and ſcarce any found ſo little, but it will lode two or three men to carry it hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely away when it is cut in pieces. The fleſh of them is very excellent good meat, when it is well powdred, and of no leſſe pleaſant taſte. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>Tortoiſe</hi> layeth commonly two or three hundred egges at a time, as big as Hens egges, but round like a ball: good likewiſe to eate, and have this propertie, that whither boiled or roſted, the white of them is alwaies ſoft. When the young ones are hatcht, they naturally make to Sea, never expecting that the old one ſhould come to feed them. To this the Tyde helps
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170201:88"/>
them very much, and there they live and thrive ſo well, that, as they ſay, ſome one of them hath been found of that bigneſs and weight, that 20. men had much adoe to lift it from the ground.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. There is, beſides theſe, infinite variety of other kindes of fiſh in the Indian or American Seas; as the <hi>Iguana,</hi> which is a kinde of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Serpent, of ſomewhat a terrible and ugly forme, but otherwiſe not at all hurtfull; of the bigneſs commonly of an Otter or Fox, the skyn ſpotted and ſmooth, and the fleſh neither unwholeſome nor unpleaſant meat. And the <hi>Bobo,</hi> which is a gallant fiſh as any belong to the Seas, of the length of a mans arme, having one only bone or griſtly ſubſtance running through the midſt of it from end to end: it is of a moſt tender and delicate ſubſtance, white as milk, and as fat as butter; excellent meat which way ſoever dreſſed, boyl'd, bak'd, ſtew'd, roaſted, or otherwiſe: And beſide theſe many others, which I muſt neceſſarily paſs over in ſilence; as likewiſe I might well doe theſe that follow, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Niguas</hi> (as the Spaniards call them) or Weſt-Indian Nits; and the <hi>Broma,</hi> or water-worme, two little Inſects indeed, and hardly to be numbred in the rank of perfect Creatures, yet ſuch as make themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable enough to be named, only by their
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170201:89"/>
troubleſomneſs; the one to Men at Land, the other to the ſhips at Seas. The <hi>Niguas</hi> are ſo ſmall a kinde of vermine, that they can hardly be perceived ſingle, nothing neer ſo bigge as a Flea, which lodge themſelves inſenſibly and unperceived at firſt, under the nails of Mens fingers and toes, and in other private parts of the body, and multiply in a ſhort time ſo ſtrangely, that they turn the party to extream pain and torture, and not ſeldome cauſe him to loſe a joint either of his hands or feet: Nor is it eaſie to prevent their breeding, without continuall bruſhing of cloaths and a great care to keep all things about a man, as much as can be, clean and dry. When they are perceived to be bred, the beſt remedy is counted to be, to pour melted wax upon the place where they are neſtled; which, though it ſcalds and be troubleſome for the time, yet when it is cold, it brings away a ſhoale of that little vermin with it, ſometimes four or five hundred of them at a pull. A cheap remedy indeed, if it be ſo effectual as they ſay. The <hi>Broma,</hi> or water-worm, is no leſs troubleſome and miſchievous to the ſhips at Sea: it is found generally in all parts within the Tropiques or Torrid Zone, and more eſpecially neer the Line: The Engliſh call it ſometimes <hi>Arters,</hi> from what ground
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170201:89"/>
I am not able to ſay; but the inconvenience and danger which it brings to ſhips, if not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, is apparent and great. They faſten commonly in ſuch great multitudes, upon the planks of a ſhip, eſpecially betwixt winde and water, where it is not leſs dangerous, that the ſhips many times are found covered with them very thick in thoſe parts, and the planks under water wrought like Hony-combs, full of a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of little cells or cavities, which the worms make in them, and in time eate through the planks, be they never ſo thick, and endanger the ſhip. They are at firſt as little as a pins head or leſs, but grow in time to the bigneſs of a Mans little finger; and the further they work into a plank, the bigger likewiſe they grow. And therefore to prevent the inconveniences that would otherwiſe certainly befall the ſhips that goe to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> they uſually ſheath them, as they call it, before they goe out, that is, they naile or faſten upon the ribs of the ſhips, under water, and betwixt winde and water ſometimes thin ſheats of lead, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times double planks of good thickneſs, both within and without. But neither of theſe wayes are counted good; partly by reaſon of the overmuch weight or ballaſt, which they give to the ſhip; and partly for that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170201:90"/>
not; for the worm eaſily works through the planks, be they never ſo thick; and the lead being very thin, waſheth away, and in time decayes ſo much, that the worm will not be hindred from entring. Others burn the outermoſt planks of the ſhip, under wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and above, to the blackneſs of a coal, and then pitch it all over with pitch: This doth reaſonable well. But the beſt remedie of all, and that which is now moſt generally uſed, is that which is ſaid to be the Invention of Sir <hi>John Hawkins,</hi> a Gentleman in his time of great experience and command at Sea. They take the ſheathing-board, which they intend to lay on, and beſmeare all the inſide of it with Tarre, half a finger thick at leaſt, and upon the Tarre another half finger thick of hair, ſuch as is commonly uſed in Morter; and then nayle it down on the ribs of the ſhip, ſo far as they judge it neceſſary, driving the nails reaſonably thick, never above a ſpan diſtance one from another. This is thought both the cheapeſt and ſecureſt way: For the Tarre either killeth the worm, as ſome think; or at leaſt, when ſhe is wrought through the ſheathing-board, the Tarre and hair together ſo involve and choak her up, that ſhe is not able to paſs fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but there ſtops and dyeth: And the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170201:90"/>
thinner the ſheathing-board is, ſo much the better.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. AMong the Commodities of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> which we call Mercantile, or ſuch as the Merchants bring from thence, the Sugars are not to be eſteemed the leaſt, whether we regard the aboundance, or great plenty of the Commoditie it ſelf that is brought, or the extraordinary gain and profit they make that bring it; it being become ſuch a general inſtrument of deliciouſneſs to all ſorts of People, in all Nations, and ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly agreeable to dainty palats. 'Tis ſaid, they buy a pound of good Sugar at the Indies for five or ſix Maravedes, which make not two pence of Engliſh monie; and in ſome places a hundred pound weight together for nine or ten Ryals of plate, which are not above five ſhillings; whereas with us in <hi>Europe,</hi> the rate of it is far otherwiſe. Some ſay it is no
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170201:91"/>
Plant of the natural growth of <hi>America,</hi> but brought thither from other parts, as namely from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> or <hi>Canarie</hi> Iſlands; which ſeems rather to be a miſtake, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the great aboundance thereof which groweth naturally, without any kinde of plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Husbandrie, in all parts of <hi>Braſil, Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guay, Tucuman,</hi> and diverſe other Provinces of <hi>America,</hi> both of the Continent and Iſlands; inſomuch that in ſome place about the River of <hi>Plate,</hi> they report, that the Canes grow to the height of ſome leſſer trees, yeelding a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable quantity of good Sugar in every joint or knot of the Cane. For originally, and at firſt, we muſt know, this delicious powder, which we call Sugar, is nothing elſe but the pith or ſweet marrow of a certain Cane or Reed, which the Latins call <hi>Saccharum,</hi> bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing the term, as 'tis thought, from the Arabicks, together with the firſt knowledge of the Plant, and we commonly the <hi>Sugar-Cane.</hi> It groweth in the manner of other reeds up into a long ſtalk, with joynts and knots in it, commonly ſeven or eight foot high, and where the Soile is luſty and proper for it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more; of the bigneſs of a Mans arme in the brawn, and ſharping up towards the top as it groweth. The joints, or knots, of the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170201:91"/>
Cane, are, for the moſt part, three or four in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches diſtant one from another, and within full of a ſpongeous and ſweet juycie ſubſtance or marrow, of which the Sugar (as we have it) is made. At every knot or joynt of the Cane, on each ſide, there groweth up a long leafe, ſharp at the point, and in the faſhion of a wing. The root of it is likewiſe long and large, and runneth not directly downward into the earth, but rather ſloping, and creeping along under the uppermoſt cruſt of the ground; out of which at ſeveral places there ſprout diverſe young Siens, or little Plants, which they cut away, both that they ſhould not draw too much of the nutriment from the principal or mother-Plant, as alſo for that they ſet them for increaſe, or a new ſtock of reeds; And 'tis ſaid to be a yeer and half commonly before a Plant of the Sugar-Cane comes to its full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or growth. But I conceive that to be much according to the nature and condition of the Soile where they grow. For in <hi>Hiſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niola</hi> (where indeed the Soile is exceeding luſty and good) 'tis ſaid they grow to a cubits height in leſs than two moneths ſpace. The ſubſtance of the root is likewiſe very ſweet and pleaſant, nothing ſo hard or woody as the roots of ſome other Canes and Reeds be, but rather
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170201:92"/>
tender and ſoft; and where the Soile is good and proper for them, one root will beare ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times twenty or thirty Canes; which in the Iſland of <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> is not unuſual; but they never ſuffer all of them to grow up for the reaſon aboveſaid. They grow both in the Plains and Hill Countrie. in a hot and moiſt Soile, and require extraordinary Husbanding, and eſpecially that the ground about them be kept clean, and free from annoyance either of weeds or any thing elſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The manner of making the Sugar, is commonly thus. When the Reeds are full grown &amp; gathered, they cut or chop them into ſmall peeces at firſt with a knife, or ſome other fitting inſtrument, and afterwards grinde, or break them into yet ſmaller, in certain huge <hi>Querns</hi> or Mills, which they have for that purpoſe. Theſe <hi>Querns</hi> goe ſometimes with wheels, and are turned about by their Slaves, who tread and labour in them juſt in the ſame manner as the Turn-ſpit Doggs doe in many places in <hi>England:</hi> Others there be that are drawn about with an Horſe, or <hi>Bufalo:</hi> But the more general way now uſed of late for grinding and bruiſing the Canes, is by water-Mills, which they finde to be far more quick and convenient, eſpecially where they have the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:170201:92"/>
opportunity of a good ſtream. When the Cane is thus broken and pulverizated in ſome ſort, they put it in great Caldrons, or boyling veſſels of Braſs, with ſome quantity of pure water, and likewiſe a ſtrong lye, or water of aſhes made for that purpoſe; and ſo boyle it, till all the ſweetneſs be quite out of the Cane, or hard ſubſtance of the Reed, and transfuſed into the liquor. When this is done, they take it out, and through a colatorie or ſtrayner they preſs out the liquor into certain great Keelers, or veſſels which they call <hi>Tangue;</hi> and afterwards boyle it again, with a leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of lye put to it: the effect of this lye is chiefly to raiſe the ſcum, and thereby to help to clarifie and refine the Sugar, by ſeparating of the ſediments and groſſer parts of it from the pure. When they have boyled it to the conſiſtency or thickneſs of Honey, they ſtrain it out again into other veſſels, which they call <hi>Tachas,</hi> and boyl it again to a yet greater thickneſs and conſiſtencie, ever adding ſome quantitie of the aforeſaid lye, and continually ſtirring and ſcumming it, as it boyleth. After this they take it out, and ſet it to cool in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain leſſer veſſels which the Spaniards call <hi>Formae,</hi> or Plates, which contain not above the quantity of two or three pound weight of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170201:93"/>
Sugar a piece. They are commonly made of earth, and perforated, or full of little holes at the bottom, through which the thinner or more liquid part of the Sugar droppeth into other veſſels appointed to receive it. It ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth commonly in theſe <hi>Formes</hi> or Plates about eight or ten dayes, both that it may be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cooled, as likewiſe to obſerve whether it be refined and purged of its ſediments ſo fully as it ought: If it be not, they boyle it once again as before. When it is cold, it look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth like ſand, or ſmall gravel of a dark brown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh colour, only it is ſofter in the hand, and crumbles not ſo harſhly as ſand doth. The way to make it white, is by a certain peculiar earth, or <hi>Marle,</hi> they uſe, which, being firſt diſſolved in water, and wrought into a kinde of ſoft clay; they ſpread it upon the Sugar, as it lyeth in the <hi>Formes</hi> or Plates, and in time it brings it to a white colour, yet more or leſs perfect, according as the Sugar it ſelf is pure and fine. And now it is fit for the Merchants, who tranſport it into all parts of <hi>Europe:</hi> where, by the Sugar-bakers Art and skill, it is yet more accurately purged and refined: but of this I cannot ſay much. It is a Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of incredible wealth and advantage to the Countrie; it being no unuſual thing for
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170201:93"/>
ſome one Sugar-Mill, or <hi>Ingenio,</hi> as they call it, to afford a revenue of thirty or fourty thouſand <hi>Pezos</hi> every yeer: and though it be likewiſe brought from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies, China,</hi> and other parts, yet is it not more plentifull in any Countrie of the World, than in <hi>America,</hi> where the Cane grows and thriveth well in all Provinces generally, but moſt kindly in hot and moiſt Countries; inſomuch that in ſome of the Iſlands they count an <hi>Ingenio,</hi> or good Sugar-Farm, to be no leſs profitable than ſome of their mines of Gold and Silver. 'Tis ſaid, that out of the only Iſland of Saint <hi>Domingo,</hi> or <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> they tranſport commonly one year with another, about a thouſand cheſts of refined Sugar, beſide that of the courſer ſort; every cheſt containing eight or ten <hi>Arrobes</hi> at leaſt, which is twenty five pound weight, according to Engliſh account, and likewiſe proportionably from other parts.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Cotton-wooll (as they call it, from the likeneſs it hath to our ordinary wooll of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> eſpecially as to matter of uſe) is another very profitable and good commoditie of the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> Though we call it wooll yet, is it the fruit of a tree, at leaſt of a ſhrub or leſſer Plant, and groweth upon it in the manner of Apples or other fruit. It groweth, as I ſaid,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170201:94"/>
ſometimes upon trees, as particularly in the Iſland of <hi>Puna</hi> in the South Sea, and in <hi>Hiſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niola,</hi> but for the moſt part upon certain leſſer ſhrubs or Plants, not much above a cubit high from the ground, or at moſt not above the height of a man at the middle. The ſubſtance of the Plant whereon it groweth, is very hard and wooddie, and no leſs thick ſet with ſprigs and branches growing out of it from below, or but little above ground; which, in time are all beautified and covered, as it were, with a purple colour'd flower, yet about the edges, and below at the ſtalk, yellow; after which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears the fruit in a round cod or hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>k, of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent bigneſs, according as the Soile is good and proper. If the Soile be warm and very luſty, they are commonly of the bigneſs of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Apples, or Quinces; if otherwiſe, leſs: When the fruit is ripe, the cod opens of it ſelf, dividing into four quarters, and the matter within it appears; which is nothing elſe but a ſoft gentle ſubſtance, much reſembling wooll in the touch, lying cloſe, and well wrapt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the cod: it groweth ſtill, that is, after the cod is opened, to the bigneſs of a mans fiſt ordinarily, and then, unleſs it be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by ſome body, it ſheds it ſelf upon the ground, as the Down-Thiſtle commonly doth,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170201:94"/>
together with its ſeed, which is a little round black ſubſtance of the bigneſs of Conies tret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, or ſome leſſer ſort of Peaſe, but flat. This is the ſeed of the Cotton; and they gather it conſtantly, and ſow it every year, in the ſame manner as they doe other Grain, <hi>viz.</hi> upon tilled Land, and in furrows; and in harveſt they reap their crop, which they have never above once upon the ſame ſtalk or Plant.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. This woolly ſubſtance of the Cotton-Apple, when it is gathered, the Indian women card and ſpin, as we doe our ordinary wooll in <hi>Europe;</hi> and there are both ſtuffs and cloth made of it of ſeveral ſorts and in great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; ſome very fine, like ſilk; others leſs fine: and of the courſeſt ſort of all they make Sails for ſhips, coverings for their Tents in the field, either when they are marching againſt an enemy, or following their Heards of Cattel to paſture, and in many other ſuch like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. And 'tis commonly the womans work, not onely to card and ſpin, but alſo to weave this cotton into cloath, eſpecially one ſort of it, <hi>viz.</hi> of which they make their <hi>Inni's,</hi> as they call them, which are certain hanging Beds, much uſed by the American People, both at <hi>Mexico</hi> and in all the Northern parts, and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170201:95"/>
likewiſe in <hi>Peru.</hi> Theſe are webs of a good ſtrong ſort of Cotton Cloath, woven about eight or nine foot long, and an ell broad, with loop-holes at each end; through which, by putting a cord or ſome ſmall line, they hang them up in their houſes upon beams or tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters made for that purpoſe; and when they are abroad in the fields, or hunting in the woods, upon the boughs of trees, or any other thing they finde convenient. They uſe them chiefly in the field, and when they march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their enemies; for they are not very troubleſome to carrie, and are much more convenient and healthfull, either to ſleep in, or lie upon, than the bare ground, eſpecially in thoſe Countries, and in the night time: And when they are foul, they make a lye of a certain great <hi>Cucumer</hi> or <hi>Gourd</hi> cut in pieces and ſteept a good while in water, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards boyled; with which they ſcowre and bring them to as perfect whiteneſs, as any Soap or Fullers-earth would be able to doe.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And becauſe the Silks, Taffaties, Sattins, and other fine Draperie of <hi>America,</hi> are not only as good for the moſt part as thoſe of the Eaſtern parts, but begin alſo now to be as great a Merchandiſe, both from <hi>Mexico</hi> and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170201:95"/>
                        <hi>Peru;</hi> and for that the Countrie affordeth ſuch good plenty of Mulberrie trees, both planted and naturally growing (the leaves whereof are the moſt proper and kindely ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenance of the Worm, which breeds and makes the Silk) I muſt not paſs it over without ſome ſhort touch at leaſt upon this ſubject, <hi>viz.</hi> of the nature of Silk it ſelf, and eſpecially of that admirable Creature <hi>the Silk-Worm,</hi> which breeds it. Silk originally is nothing elſe but a fine thred ſpun out of the bowels of a certain Worm, which the Latins call <hi>Bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byx,</hi> we in Engliſh co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly <hi>the Silk Worm;</hi> in ſame the manner as the common Spider weaves his dusky, yet curious web, out of himſelf. The Worm at the Indies is of the bigneſs of a Mans finger or thumb, ſomewhat greater than thoſe of <hi>Italy</hi> and other parts of <hi>Europe;</hi> and is bred two manner of waies: that is to ſay, by putrefaction, as other Inſects commonly are, and alſo by a more proper and ſpecifical generation. The firſt is, according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of <hi>Pliny</hi> in his <hi>Naturall Hiſtory,</hi> of the Flowers of the Cypreſs and Turpentine trees, and likewiſe many times of the Aſh and Oake, which, in time of year, either fall from the trees of themſelves, or elſe are beaten off with rain-ſhowers; out of which leaves corrupted and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170201:96"/>
putrified upon the ground, there is ſoon after, by the heat of the Sun and the exhalations or vapours that iſſue out of the earth, a certain Inſect ingendred, of the bigneſs of a Butter flie, naked and ſmooth at firſt, like a Worm; but, in time, coming to be over-grown with a kinde of hair, and after that with a thicker and warmer coat, which, againſt winter, the Inſect works for it ſelf out of the Cotton, or downy fillets of thoſe leaves among which it was bred, or can otherwiſe come by. Their other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of breeding is by generation properly ſo called, that is, by coupling of Sexes: for there is both Male and Female of them. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thus. The Silk-worm, after he hath wrought up his bagge, or ball of ſilk to the full, ſoon after dyeth within it; and though he leaves but a poor <hi>Skeleton</hi> or thin <hi>corps</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him; yet out of it, laid in ſome cloſe ſubterraneous room, where no winde cometh, in a few dayes after it is putrified, there ſprings a pair of other Inſects or worms of the ſame kinde, though not altogether of the ſame fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure or ſhape; for they are both horned and winged. Theſe the Latins call <hi>Chryſalides,</hi> and ſeem to be made only for generation, or preſerving the kinde: for as much as they doe nothing elſe but gender for the ſpace of three
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170201:96"/>
or four dayes together; at the end whereof the Male dieth, leaving the Female behinde him impregnated and big with a numerous iſſue of little egges, to the number of one hundred ſometimes or more, of the bigneſs of Millet ſeeds, or ſome other ſmaller ſort of grain; of which aſſoon as ſhe is delivered, ſhe likewiſe followeth the Male, and dyeth.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Out of theſe eggs (for ſo the Authors perpetually call them) a new Breed or Stock of wormes, is to be gotten, which is the ſecond manner of their breeding, as hath been ſaid; neither is it the leaſt part of the care and skill of thoſe that keep Silke-wormes, and trade in the making of Silk, to hatch them well: the beſt way whereof, and moſt commonly uſed in <hi>Italy,</hi> and other parts, is ſaid to be the naturall heat of a woman, either in bed, or otherwiſe carrying them about her, in her boſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt her breaſts; eſpecially if ſhe be a woman of good complexion, or a Virgin: and ſo they are hatched commonly in three or four dayes. They keep the eggs all Winter long for the moſt part, and without any great inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, not thinking of hatching them, till the Mulberie-trees be well bloſom'd, the leaves whereof are their moſt naturall food, and are ſeldome out before the latter end of <hi>May,</hi> or
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170201:97"/>
beginning of <hi>June.</hi> When the eggs are hatch't, and the worm appeares, the next care is to procure it ſuſtenance, whereby it may grow to a bigneſs, and ſtrength able to work. Their beſt meat, as I ſaid, is the Mulbury leaves; for though they feed them ſometimes with the leaves of <hi>Rubus,</hi> or the great Bramble, with Lettice, and likwiſe with Nettle-leaves; yet neither doe they thrive ſo well, nor weave ſo bigge a web, as they doe, when they are fed with the Mulberry-leaf. They feed with a great appetite, aſſoone as ever they are bred, eating conſtantly thrice a day, <hi>viz.</hi> at Morning, Noon, and Night, when they are young; and when they are grown to ſome bigneſs, five or ſix times every day. After they have fed well for the ſpace of nine or ten dayes together, and their bellies are full, they are taken with a kinde of dead ſleep: which holds them for the moſt part three or four dayes together: and though it be a ſickneſſe and ſome weakning to them, yet they awake of themſelves, and in time by good handling ſeem to be revived with it, and fall to feeding afreſh. And this they doe conſtantly, that is, feed, ſleep, and revive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, three ſeverall times at leaſt before they come to their full ſtrength, or to be able to weave: which is commonly about fourty or
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170201:97"/>
fifty dayes after their firſt birth. When they have had their laſt and longeſt ſleep; for the ſpace of eight or ten dayes together afterwards they feed the ſtoutlieſt of all, and then quite give over; which they that keep them percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, know that now their belly is full, and that they are ready to worke out all again that they have hitherto eaten, with the advantage of a rare intereſt beſide. They know it alſo by this, that the bagge of Silk, that is to ſay, the matter out of which the Worme afterward ſpins the Silk, begins to appeare, and to ſhine through the lawn coverture or thin ſides of the worm. Againſt which time they that look to their working, have alwayes in readineſs ſome boughs or branches of the Oke, Cheſnut, or any other tree, whoſe ſubſtance is very hard and dry: for upon ſuch they alwayes work beſt; any degree of moiſtneſs, how little ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, whither of the aire, or in their Loomes, or otherwiſe, being counted very prejudiciall both to the Worm and web. Upon theſe boughs they lay the Wormes, which preſently fall to work and ſpinning of their thred from one twig to another, backward, forward and athwart, as themſelves pleaſe, alwaies wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king inward, that is from the circumference to the center or middle part, till at laſt they have
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170201:98"/>
ſpun out a round bag of Silk, for the moſt part of an Ovil or oblong figure, in which laſt of all they cloſe up themſelves; yet ſtill continuing to work, till they have either wholly or well nigh filled up the bag within, and that the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome within themſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> within their bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells, and out of which they ſpin, be quite ſpent and unravelled. The bag, or web which theſe Silk-wormes ſpin is many times as big as a mans head all of one thred, ſo fine, that it can hardly be diſcerned, but by very good eyes, and ſpun out ſo long without any rupture or once breaking off, that, as <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> affirmeth, ſome one, of them might be able to circle about the biggeſt City in <hi>Italy.</hi> The colour of it is different, white, yellow, green; or otherwiſe, according either to the nature of the Climate and Country where they work, or to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the food, with which the wormes are fed. This ſpinning holds them conmonly nine or ten dayes. When all is done, and they are come, as it were, to the laſt thred of the Clue, and that the Worme, by filling up the bottome of the bag, hath quite emptied her ſelf, in a ſhort time ſhe dies, as we ſaid before, in the midſt of her ſelf made priſon and work: and there ſpring out of her <hi>Skeleton,</hi> after ſome few days, two other leſſer Wormes, of the ſame
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170201:98"/>
kinde, though differing ſomewhat in ſhape and figure; whoſe buſineſs is onely to propagate, as we likewiſe ſaid; and that being done they die: and the Silk-maſters unravelling again the whole web, or bag of ſilk, which the dead Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt hath wrought, order it according to their own skill, as may be moſt fit for the Merchant; of which I can ſay but little.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. This is the generation of Silk-wormes, which as briefly as I could, I have deſcribed from the report of divers Authors; eſpecially of <hi>Hieronimus Vida</hi> his curious and elegant poem of this ſubject intituled <hi>de Bombyce:</hi> and this is the originall and firſt ground of Silk, that ſo rare and ſo much eſteemed veſture: it is but the entrayles of a Worme, an effect of putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and rottenneſs: which if the Gallants and Ladies of the world, when they ruffle moſt in it, would be pleaſ'd a little to reflect upon, perhaps it would doe them no harm; and be a means, that while it renders their outward perſonages comely and fine, as it doth, it ſhould not put their inward and better part ſo much out of faſhion.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. As for the Mulberry trees, the leaves whereof are ſaid to be the moſt naturall and kindely ſuſtenance that can be for the Silk-wormes, I have not much to ſay of them; only
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170201:99"/>
this. They are Trees of ſomewhat a larger ſize than ordinary, of a great body or trunk and alſo of high growth. They beare their fruit in cluſters like grapes, being indeed nothing elſe but a multitude of ſmall berries growing together upon one long bunch, juſt as grapes doe. The leaves are broad and ſomewhat thick, of a very green colour, and ſharpening to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end in faſhion of a heart ſeeming to be ſnipt or cut round about the edges with little gaſhes, more or leſs deep, according to the kinde of the Mulberry: for there are two ſorts of them, <hi>viz</hi> the black &amp; the white; ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the colour of the fruit which they bear: the firſt whereof, when ripe is outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly black, but the pulpe of it, or jucy ſubſtance within red or of a deep murry; the other white and of a more pleaſant taſt, ſomething reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling wine. They grow beſt in hot Countries: and where they make Silk, there are whole Woods and Groves of them, made or preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on purpoſe, onely for the Silk-wormes to feed on. Of all the Trees of the Garden it is counted to be the laſt that putteth forth its bloſſomes; which it never doth till about the end of <hi>May,</hi> or beginning of <hi>June,</hi> when all the cold weather is gone: and till then the Silk-wormes alſo, where they breed naturally and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:170201:99"/>
not by the art and care of man, lye dead like ſo many little grains or ſeeds, or like the dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of fleſh-flies, upon the ground; but after that time begin to revive and ſhew themſelves; as if there were ſome naturall ſympathy and correſpondence betwixt the one and the other. They grow either naturally of a ſlip of their own kinde, or by the inoculation or grafting upon ſome other Trees: and the white Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry is commonly a graft upon that which is called the white Poplar. There are good ſtore of them ſaid to be at <hi>Bermudaz, Virginia,</hi> and ſome other Engliſh Plantations; which, if the Planters had Skill, or were enjoyned to mind the buſineſs, might in time afford great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Silks, and a richer trade and employment than any other Commodity they yet deale in. But they think not of it; and therefore it may well ſuffice to have ſpoken thus much of the buſineſs.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the abundance and excellency of the Metals at the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> eſpecially of Gold and Silver.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>AMerica</hi> or the <hi>New World,</hi> is doubtleſs a Country admirable rich, &amp; which the Soveraign Creator of all things hath plentifully ſtored with all ſorts of the moſt excellent and rare endowments of nature, as well in the rank and order of things inanimate or without life, as of living creatures; according as in part wee have ſeen allready, and may be more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and to admiration obſerved, as the ſcattered inſtances or tokens of his Divine Magnificence and bounty, in all the Hiſtories and reports of the Country. But of that wherein it ſeemes moſt of all to excell, wee have yet ſpoken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>viz.</hi> of the Metals, which alone were able to render it the moſt deſirable part of the World, though it had no other advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. It aboundeth with all ſorts of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Iron, Braſs, Copper, Lead, Tin, &amp;c. But the excellency and richneſs of the other two, <hi>viz.</hi> Gold and Silver, and likewiſe of that which is as it were, the Sperm and Solder of theſe, and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170201:100"/>
of all other Metals beſide, <hi>viz.</hi> Quickſilver, is ſuch, that it makes all the reſt to be neither much ſpoken of, nor much ſought after in theſe parts. In which reſpect I conceive I may be more eaſily excuſed, if I paſs them over likewiſe in ſilence, and make <hi>Thoſe</hi> only the ſubject of my following diſcourſe, which are ſo much (would to God I might not as truly ſay <hi>too-much</hi>) the ſubject of all our deſires, <hi>viz.</hi> the Metals of Gold and Silver.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Among all Metalls, Gold hath juſtly the preheminence or firſt place, in the eſteeme of men, by reaſon of its naturall perfection and purity, which is ſuch, as it renders the Metal in a manner incorruptible and of immortall durance. It is not improbably conceived to be a ſubſtance, wherein the Elements, <hi>viz.</hi> Fire, Earth, Water, &amp;c. (which are the naturall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients and conſtitution of all other ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary bodies) are mixed with moſt equall and exact proportion, both for quantity and quality, that is, there is no more of the Subſtance of any of them found in it, then the condition of the reſt will moſt fitly agree with and endure, and that ſubſtance likwiſe moſt perfectly defecate and purged by the work of nature from all intrinſecall impurity or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, before it meets in compoſition with
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170201:101"/>
the reſt, whence ariſeth ſuch a perfect Union and Conſolidation of all the Elementall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the ſubſtance of Gold as is invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and reſiſteth the actiivity of all other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies whatſoever leſs purified, and leſs perfectly mixed, whoſe contrariety ſhould otherwiſe cauſe corruption, or the diſſolution of its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall and eſſentiall parts. I ſay the Elements in the compoſition of Gold, are both ſo pure in themſelves, and likewiſe ſo perfectly mixed in due proportion to another, that it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally impoſſible they ſhould be ſeparate, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved one from another by the action of any other body, in which 'tis evident, they are not ſo perfectly mixed. Yea the Fire it ſelf, the moſt active of all Elements and Elementary bodies, which incinerates and turns to Aſhes, the ſubſtance of all common Metals, and ſenſibly waſteth Silver it ſelf, yet prevails noe further upon this, than only to refine and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie it, that is, to deliver it from the adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and improper mixture of other Metals; but waſteth not one dram or ſcruple of pure Gold, though you melt it a hundred times o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. This renders Gold in a manner incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible and immortall (ſpeaking naturally) and by conſequence the moſt excellent and fitting inſtrument of commerce and bartery that the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170201:101"/>
wit and reaſon of man could invent or deſire. Second in excellency and in all properties of perfection unto Gold, is that of Silver; a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or Metallick body, wherein the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of water ſeems to pravail in ſome undue proportion above that of fire rendring thereby the whole ſubſtance of the Metall of a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution flegmatick, as I may ſay, and feminine, that is weak and leſs able to reſiſt contrarieties, as appeares by the pale colour of it, and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience upon all occaſions of tryall: yet in compariſon of all other Metals except Gold only) it is with all reaſon preferred, and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs excells them all both in purity and perfection of mixture, as much as it ſelf is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled by gold; and perhaps much more. For I obſerve, the Metals of gold and ſilver doe (both of them) exceed all the other ſorts of Metals, whither Iron, Braſs, Copper, &amp;c. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably or beyond compariſon, as wee ſay; I mean, there never was any certain compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or proportion of value, fixed and ſetled betwixt the one and the other by eſtimation or the common conſent of men, as to ſay how much a pound of Gold is better worth than a pound of Iron; or a pound of Silver than a pound of Braſs or Lead; not but that it may be eaſily calculated and known, how much the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170201:102"/>
one exceeds the other in value; but becauſe <hi>it is not commonly known,</hi> nor ever was, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, by any general and certain eſtimation or count among men: whereas the proportion, or difference in value, betwixt gold and ſilver, hath ever been generally and certainly known among men; not indeed ſo fixed &amp; certain as to be alwaies, &amp; in all places, one and the ſame (for it varieth according to times and places, and eſpecially according as either the one or the other metal is plentiful, or ſcarſe, needfull, or counted leſs neceſſary among men) but yet a proportion or ſome certain difference in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue hath been ever commonly eſtimated and aſſigned betwixt them. Anciently the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion betwixt theſe metals is ſaid to have been of <hi>ten for one,</hi> that is, one talent of gold was held to be worth ten talents of ſilver; ſo that if five talents of gold were due, and a man would make payment in ſilver, he ſhould pay fifty talents; and for fifty due in gold, five hundred in ſilver. <hi>Pliny</hi> reports, that at the firſt coyning of theſe metals in <hi>Rome,</hi> the proportion was fourteen and an half or fifteen for one; others, as <hi>Herodotus,</hi> ſpeak of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen. But that which ſeems now to be moſt common at the Indies, <hi>China,</hi> and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, eſpecially where ſilver is ſcarce, is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170201:102"/>
of twelve for one; So that if an ounce of ſilver be worth five ſhillings, as it is ſaid to be, an ounce of gold is worth three pound ſterling, &amp; a pound of gold in weight worth no leſs than fourty eight pound of ſilver in Coyn.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Of this Metal, <hi>viz</hi> gold, there is ſuch plenty at the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> that, beſide the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite rich Mines thereof, which they have in all the Provinces of the Southern part, <hi>viz. Peru, Caſtella del oro, Chile, &amp;c.</hi> and likewiſe in many of them in the Northern, eſpecially in the Countries of <hi>Nicaragua, Veragua, Guadalaiara,</hi> there is ſcarſe a River of note in all thoſe parts, but the ſands of it are well powder'd with gold, and afford good ſtore of it to the waſhers: yea the very earth, or common ſoil, which they dig, or otherwiſe take up in moſt parts of <hi>Peru,</hi> is ſo tinctured with it, and yeelds ever and anon ſuch grains and crumblings of it, that <hi>Acoſta,</hi> an Author no way laviſh of his reports, nor of a light judgement, profeſſeth to think there is much more of the metal yet to be diſcovered than hath been found; judging, as he doth, by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral qualitie or tincture of the Soile. There be three ſorts of gold at the Indies, or rather the ſame gold or metal they finde in three ſeveral manners or waies, <hi>viz. in grains,</hi> as they call
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170201:103"/>
them, <hi>in powder,</hi> and <hi>in ſtone.</hi> Gold <hi>in graines</hi> they call certain ſmall pieces of gold, which they finde in the earth, of pure and perfect me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, without mixture of any other ſort of baſer alloy, or at leaſt with ſo ſmall a mixture, as it ſcarſe needeth melting or refining. Theſe the Spaniards in <hi>America</hi> call <hi>Pepones,</hi> from ſome reſemblance which the grains have to the ſeeds of Melons or Pompions; though many times they are much bigger, and contain a pound weight or more. They finde ſilver likewiſe ſometimes in the ſame manner, <hi>viz</hi> in grains, and pure; but that is but ſeldome, and a little in compariſon of what they finde of the other. Gold <hi>in ſtone,</hi> is a vein or little Mine of gold, which groweth and ſpreadeth it ſelf into branches in ſome flint or other ſtone, juſt as ſilver doth in the Mine. Much of this ſort is found in the Mines of <hi>Curuma,</hi> and about the <hi>Salinas</hi> or <hi>Salt-wooks</hi> of <hi>Peru,</hi> a place ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; where they finde huge ſtones pierced ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times quite through, and interlaced every way with veins of gold, in ſuch quantity, and ſo richly, that the ſtone is found, not ſeldom, to be more than half gold. Of this ſort is that which they finde moſt commonly in the Mines, and is very good gold, but requireth exceſſive labour and pains to break it from the ſtone,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170201:103"/>
and to get it forth. Gold <hi>in powder,</hi> is that which they gather in Rivers, Brooks, and other places where any ſtore of water paſſeth from the Mountains, the ſtreams or torrents where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, bring along with them, from the ſaid mountains, aboundance of this metal in ſmall pieces, which, as it comes, ſetleth continually in the ſands and breaches of the ſaid Rivers, where afterwards it is found. I ſay the gold it ſelf is moſt probably thought to be ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred on the tops of the mountains or moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous parts of the Earth, and perhaps not far from the Source and Springs of thoſe Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in which it is found, and into whoſe ſtreams it is eaſily conceived to be devolved in tract of time, by ſhowres of rain, and by many other natural cauſes; and is not bred or ingendred in the ſand or ſtream it ſelf: And ſo likewiſe 'tis obſerved, they finde moſt plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it commonly after ſome great floods. Of this ſort of gold they gather greateſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity; there being, as I ſaid, ſcarſe a River of note in the whole Country of <hi>Peru,</hi> or Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern part of <hi>America,</hi> whoſe ſands are not more or leſs tinctured and enamel'd with it. And it is moſt plentifull, ſo is it likewiſe, for the moſt part, very pure, and needs not half that labour of refining it, which gold <hi>in ſtone,</hi>
                        <pb n="188" facs="tcp:170201:104"/>
or of the Mine uſually doth. To gather it, they firſt of all divert, or turn the courſe of the ſtream ſome other way, and then ſearch the Ford, eſpecially in the breaches, if there be any, and in the cliffs, or hollow places of the banks, where it is likely it may ſettle in its paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage with the waters: and in ſuch places they alwaies finde beſt ſtore. It is, for the moſt part, the womens work to gather this ſort of gold; which they doe in this manner. They ſit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly knee-deep in the water, upon the bank of ſome River, or other place, where they have good ſtore of water before them, with a Trey or little Bole in their hands, cut ſloping on either ſide, but in the midſt deep and round, like the bottom of a Barbors Baſon, having a good quantity of the ſand which they are to waſh, continually ſtanding by them, &amp; which is brought to them by ſome other body appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſerve them: Of this ſand they take what quantity they think fit, and waſh it in their Treys, in ſuch manner, as the ſand and ſandy earth eaſily waſheth away together with the water, and the gold, by reaſon of its heavineſs and weight, naturally ſinks down and ſlips into the deep bottom or bole of the Trey: which when they have done, they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it likewiſe to others that ſtand there to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170201:104"/>
receive it, and take in more ſand. So that to every Trey, or waſher of gold, there are three or four perſons at leaſt appointed to attend, <hi>viz.</hi> one to bring the ſand from the River to the waſher, another to receive the gold when it is waſhed, one to overſee the work, and another to provide victuals and neceſſaries for them all. For they ſtir not from morning till night, from the place where they work. And thus you ſhall ſee hundreds of people waſhing and ſearching for gold all along the banks of the Rivers. This is generally the way of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of gold: as for their manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining it, we ſhall ſpeak of that and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining of ſilver all under one.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Silver they finde either in veins <hi>ſtragling,</hi> as they call them, or <hi>fixed.</hi> The firſt is, when they finde ſome piece, or a few ſmall pieces of that metal alone; which when they have taken out of the Mine, or ſtone, there is no more of it to be found. The other is, when the vein of the metal runneth out, and ſpreads it ſelf up and down the Mine, in breadth and length, upward, downward, and every way, like the root of a tree with arms, boughs, and branches; for ſo for the moſt part it doth; and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraliſts doe commonly repreſent the Mines of theſe metals, eſpecially of ſilver, by the type
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170201:105"/>
of a tree planted within the bowels, or middle part, of ſome great mountain, with its root ſpreading largely downward, and with its boughs and branches reaching as far upwards, even to the top, or higher parts of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; at which it uſually diſcovers it ſelf, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſome part of the pure vein it ſelf, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out, and running along upon the ridges of the mountain, or but little within the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Earth, or elſe by the ſignes; which are certain fumoſities, or metallick exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which the Mine ſendeth forth, of diverſe colours, <hi>viz.</hi> yellowiſh, white, blew, green, according to the ſtrength and quality of the Mine, and its neer approach to the ſurface of the Earth. Theſe ſignes, where they finde them, they call <hi>Marchaſites;</hi> and the neerer they approach in colour to the metal which they ſignifie, the better ſignes they are accounted to be, as arguing that the Mine is rich, and that the metal within the ground is well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted and pure. This, we muſt know, is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule to diſcover and finde the Mines, but not univerſal. For ſometimes they venture to dig, and fall upon very good Mines, without any ſuch ſpecial ſignes appearing, only induced by the quality of the earth, and the natural barrenneſs of the mountain or place where
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:170201:105"/>
they digge. And 'tis generally counted in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru</hi> a ſigne good enough, if the mountain or mountainous part of the Earth which they pitch upon (for in ſuch a Soile only the beſt and richeſt Mines are found) be very rugged, hard, and ſharp, and ſo abſolutely barren, that not a Tree, Plant, or Shrub, groweth on it, and that the graſs (if yet it bear any) be of a faint withered colour, and ſeeming, as it were, to be parched with drought. Theſe veins lye commonly deep within ground, yet affording very good and pure metal. The principal veins of the Mine, for the moſt part, run directly North and South, yet branching themſelves into leſſer boughs ſeveral wayes, <hi>viz.</hi> Eaſt, Weſt, and towards all quarters, being found many times five or ſix foot broad, and ſeldom ſo narrow as a ſpan, and this running and branching of the veins in the Mine, they call the <hi>Chaſe.</hi> The way of digging for the metal is diverſe. Sometimes they begin at the top, or upper part of the mountain, where they firſt obſerve the <hi>Marchaſites,</hi> or ſignes of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and ſink the Mine downward like a well, only taking a convenient ſpace of ground for the platform or compaſs of the Mine, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Stanzas,</hi> or places to reſt upon and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch neceſſary buſineſs, at a certain diſtance
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170201:106"/>
one from another continually, as they work deeper into the Mine. The other is, to begin to digge at the foot, or neer the bottom of the mountain, in line almoſt level, that is, ſloping a little upwards, and till they come perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicularly under the place, where they firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the tokens of the metal; it being a thing generally preſumed by the Miners, that though every Mine of metal that may be in the body of a mountain, doth not ſhew it ſelf by ſignes at the top, as when it lyes very deep within ground, or is obſtructed by ſome Quarrey of ſtone or otherwiſe, yet whereſoever any ſuch ſignes of it doe appear at the top, there it reacheth to the bottom of the mountain or to the level of the plain ground, at leaſt well nigh to it, and that the deeper the Mine runs within ground, the bigger and better it is, verifying in a new ſenſe the proverb, <hi>The beſt is at the bottome.</hi> This is counted the beſt way of Mining, and moſt commodious in many reſpects, eſpecially for drayning away of the waters, which are commonly found in the Mineral hills, and doe extreamly trouble the Miners in their work, if they be not diverted; and likewiſe for carrying the ſilver out of the Mines when it is digged: neither of which can be done the other way, <hi>viz.</hi> where the Mine
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170201:106"/>
is ſunk right downward, without exceſſive la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, charge, time, and hazard to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; but this way are done with eaſe. For the waters that iſſue out of the chinks of the mountain, and fall into the Mines, are eaſily received into certain Ciſterns, made for the purpoſe, and by pipes diverted which way they pleaſe; and the ſilver is no leſs eaſily carried out of the Mine: For the way to the mouth of it being either level or ſloping downwards, the poor Miners are not forced to mount with it upon their backs, as they doe the other way two hundred, ſometimes three hundred <hi>ſtades,</hi> or man-heights, from the place where they dig it, upon ladders made of Neats-hides or leather, and from which, many times by miſchance, they fall down with it into the Mines upon their backs, and are broken to pieces. If they dig far into the mountain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come at the Mine, they are forced to uſe the Compaſs to direct their courſe, as if they were at Sea, according as by the ſignes they obſerved the vein to run, when they firſt found it. They have likewiſe another advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the water, when they dig the Mine this way, <hi>viz.</hi> that by the force of it in the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel or pipes, by which it runs out of the Mine, they turn about certain Mills, and other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170201:107"/>
by which they break and grinde the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, when they have gotten it out of the Rock, and prepare it for the refining; doing likewiſe thereby many other neceſſary buſineſſes apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the Mines. Nevertheleſs about and neer to the mouth of the Mine, they have hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of all neceſſary office beſide, for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and other workmen; and eſpecially a Smiths Forge, for the ſharpening and repairing of their tools: for their labour is exceſſive hard and difficult, and it requires both edged tools and ſtrong armes to ſplit the hard metal, and break it out of the Mine; which they are forced to doe with wedges, hammers, and all ſorts of inſtruments, and with no leſs difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie than they break the hardeſt flynt, or any other Quarry of ſtone. They labour likewiſe perpetually in them, I mean, by turns, ſo as while one company worketh, another ſleepeth and takes reſt: but the work it ſelf of the Mine never ſtands ſtill, but goeth continually on night and day; of which, in the Mines, they know no difference, working altogether by candle-light, as well by day as by night, and without which, their noon and their midnight would be both alike. For indeed the Mines in this reſpect may be taken for the Suburbs of Hell, by reaſon of their extream darkneſs; and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170201:107"/>
how neer ſoever they be to that which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth all things, yet they alwaies want there three of the chief comforts of Nature, having neither Sun nor Light, nor good Aire in the Mines.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The laſt and moſt curious work about the Metals is the refining of them, that is, the ſeparating and purging them from the mixture of other courſer metals, with which they are alwaies more or leſs ingendred in the Mines. This is done two manner of waies, either by Fire, or by Quick-ſilver. The Indians ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, before the Spaniards came among them, uſed no other way of refining but onely by fire, and melting of the metal. To which end they had uſually, and have ſtill in many places, to this day, ſeveral ſmall furnaces, which they call <hi>Guayras,</hi> built neer the Mines, in places where the winde commonly bloweth; with which, without further trouble or need of bellows, only by ſupplying them with wood or coale from time to time, as ſhall be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, they make their refining. And they ſay there is ſome kinde of ſilver, particularly that of <hi>Potozi,</hi> which will not be melted by any artificial winde they can make, as of the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, or otherwiſe, but only by that which is natural of the <hi>Guayras:</hi> and therefore upon
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170201:108"/>
the ſides of that huge mountain, <hi>viz. Potozi,</hi> there are commonly ſeen five or ſix thouſand of theſe <hi>Guayras,</hi> or little fires, burning all at one time together; which in an evening, or dark night, they ſay is a very pleaſant ſpectacle, to behold them blazing all at once, like ſo many little Comets, or fixed Meteors of the Earth. But the more common and ſpeedy way is to refine by Quick-ſilver, which the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards doe now generally uſe; both becauſe they have extraordinary plenty of it, and becauſe they finde it draws more ſilver out of the maſs which they refine, than by fire they can doe.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Quick-ſilver among metals is like water among the elements, it is the glue and ſolder of them, <hi>viz.</hi> when it is refracted and in due proportion: for otherwiſe, when it is united, and entire in it ſelf, it ſeparates and conſumes all of them but gold and ſilver. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect they call it not improperly the <hi>Humidum radicale</hi> of metals. It is a liquid ſubſtance, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no certain form or fixed ſubſiſtence of it ſelf, but runs continually from place to place, as gold and ſilver, or other metals doe, when they are melted, yet is it the heavieſt and moſt compacted of all other metals; for they all ſwim upon quick-ſilver, and will never ſink to the bottom. They ſay a piece of Iron of two
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:170201:108"/>
or three pound weight hath been caſt into a little barrel or veſſel of quick-ſilver, which ſwam upon the top of it, like corke, or ſome piece of light wood in a veſſel of water, and would not ſink; only gold, they ſay, will ſink; which they attribute to a ſecret propertie and ſympathie, that is betwixt thoſe two metals. It hath many rare and admirable properties; but that which may ſeem moſt remarkable, and which fits it ſo much for the effect we are now ſpeaking of, <hi>viz.</hi> the refining and purifying of the metals, is the natural ſympathie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination which it hath to gold and ſilver, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the firſt; which it naturally ſeeks out, where it is to be found, among all metals, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates and divides it from them all, and it ſelf embracing and circling it round about im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, and without the mixture or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of any thing elſe but it ſelf. In the ſame manner, but not altogether ſo intimately and perfectly it unites with ſilver; not pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating the ſubſtance of the metal, which the perfect compoſition thereof, if it be pure and fine, reſiſteth and forbiddeth as hath been ſaid, but only embracing and circling about it on all ſides, yet piercing and conſuming the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer metals, if there be, and ſo long as there be any of them mixed with it. And though it be
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170201:109"/>
of it ſelf the heavieſt of all other metals, yet is it ſooneſt tranſmuted or changed into the lighteſt ſubſtance of all, <hi>viz.</hi> ſmoak; which a little fire preſently doth: and that ſmoak eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating, and flying up into any colder Region or when it encounters any cold metal, as in the head or top of a Still, it preſently gathers together again, and becomes perfect quick-ſilver. Hence it ſerveth ſo excellently well to refine and purifie both theſe metals, <hi>viz.</hi> gold and ſilver, and likewiſe to be it ſelf ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from them again afterward. It groweth naturally in the Vermillion, or <hi>Minium,</hi> which is a metal well known &amp; much uſed for paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; dying; and of which they have admirable rich Mines in diverſe parts of <hi>America;</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe of <hi>Palcas,</hi> out of which they draw yearly, only for the Kings uſe, a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>pezos</hi> of mine; and thoſe of <hi>Guancavilca,</hi> which yeeld every yeer eight or nine thouſand Quintals, or ſo many times one hundred twenty five pound weight of quick-ſilver: And of another they report, that a poor Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of <hi>Acoria,</hi> who firſt found it, ſold the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt which he thereby had in the Mine, <hi>viz.</hi> for diſcovering of it, for two hundred and fiftie thouſand Duckats, and afterwards commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a ſuit againſt the buyer for deceiving him
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170201:109"/>
in the bargain; it being found, that his only intereſt in the Mine, for finding it, was well worth five hundred thouſand pound and more. Before they can uſe it for the refining &amp; purging of other metals, they muſt firſt ſeparate it from the ſtone or metal in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> it groweth. This they eaſily doe by fire, which melts the ſtone, being firſt well grinded or broken, &amp; the quick-ſilver evaporates in ſmoak up to the head or top of the Limbeck, or veſſell wherein it is melted, where encountring a colder ſubſtance, it as quickly congregats and thickens again, and would fall preſently down again, but that in the diſcent it is by pipes in the head of the Limbe k or Stillatorie diverted into ſome other veſſels ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to receive it. They keep it in nothing ſo well as in leather-veſſels: for any thing of wood or ordinary metal it would eate through and deſtroy: and 'tis ſaid, they ſpend only at the Mines of <hi>Potozi,</hi> in the refining of ſilver by it, 6 or 7000 Quintals, one year with another.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Silver, if it be good, even when 'tis firſt digged out of the Mine, is of a white greyiſh colour, like the beſt ſort of Amber: but if it looks darker, inclining any thing to black or red, it is not counted good, but rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to have in it a great quantity of earth and droſs, which muſt be purged away in the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:170201:110"/>
refining: Nevertheleſs they count it no ill vein, when every pound weight of metal out of the Mine yeelds but two or three <hi>pezos</hi> of perfect ſilver, when 'tis refined. Now the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of refining metals by quick-ſilver, and alſo of ſeparating the quick-ſilver again from the metals, when they are perfectly refined, is thus. Firſt of all with hammers, and other inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the purpoſe, they break and grinde the metals as ſmall as poſſibly they can, redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them, ſo neer as may be, into a duſt or powder, which they afterwards ſift through a ſearſe of Copper, and then put it into certain Troughs or broad open veſſels, being firſt moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened or well ſteept in brine or ſalt water. This they doe, becauſe the ſalt hath a certain quick penetrative force in it, and is apt to ſeparate the earthly and droſſie parts which as yet ſtick to the metal, and conſequently makes it more fit to receive and draw the quick ſilver to it. When this is done, they ſet the veſſels which contain the powder, or pulverizated ſubſtance of the metals upon little furnaces, with a ſoft fire under them, which they increaſe by little and little. This is done, becauſe the fire alſo is obſerved very much to help and facilitate the incorporating of the quick-ſilver, with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. After this having the quick-ſilver
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170201:110"/>
or Mercury (as the Chymiſts call it from its nimbleneſs and active, ſearching into the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals) in a piece of Holland, or ſome other fine and ſtrong linnen, they preſs or ſtrain it through the cloath upon the metal in the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells; upon which it falleth in ſmall drops like dew: ſome body in the mean time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually moving and ſtirring the metal up and down in the veſſel, while the quick-ſilver drops upon it, and afterwards alſo at times, for the ſpace of five or ſix dayes together: in which time the mercury will be ſo perfectly incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate with the metal, and have united it ſelf ſo intimately to it, that nothing ſhall be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, but that all the droſs, earth, or other courſe metal whatſoever, with which it was naturally engendred or mixed before, ſhall be either conſumed or ſeparated from it. After ſome time, when the Refiners think the Mercury hath done his part, and be perfectly incorporated with the metal that is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, they take the whole quantity or maſs of it together, out of the Troughs or veſſels where they are, and put it into certain other veſſels, which are bigger and almoſt full of water; in which they again fall to ſtir and to move the quick-ſilver and metal together up and down the veſſel, in ſuch manner, as that the earth and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:170201:111"/>
droſſie parts of the metal, ſeparated from the other, doe paſs away with the water, and the ſilver or gold united with the mercurie, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more ponderous and weighty ſubſtances, remain at the bottom: which they take out and waſh yet once again in Keelers, or certain broad and deep platters, till it ſeem throughly purged from the earth and droſſie ſubſtance. The metal thus united with mercury appears like ſmall ſand. And becauſe there alwaies ſlips away ſome portion of ſilver and quick-ſilver with the droſs in the waſhings, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they commonly waſh that droſs over and over again, till at length nothing be loſt either of the one or other. When they are thus throughly cleanſed from the droſs, they appear bright and ſhining, either with a white or yellowiſh colour, according to the proper nature of the metal that is united with the mercury. And by this they know the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals are refined as much as they ought. Then followeth the laſt piece of work, which is to ſeparate the mercury or quick-ſilver from the metal, wherewith it is incorporate, that ſo they may have the pure metal alone. And this is done thus.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Firſt they ſtrain it, as before, through a piece of ſtrong fine linnen, or Holland, as forcibly as
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:170201:111"/>
they can by this means if there be any Quick-ſilver not incorporate and united with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, it paſſeth out as before in little drops like dew which they gather and ſave; and the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſilver and quick-ſilver united remain in one lump together: which with much art and diligence they work laſt of all into the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of a Sugar-loaf, containing moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly one hundred pound weight in the whole, and made hollow in the midſt. This they ſet upon a furnace, covered with a certain earthern veſſell in the nature of a Limbeck or Still, but of the ſame faſhion, and mould that the metall within is, <hi>viz.</hi> of a Sugar-loaf, laying ſome few coals upon the top of it, and giving a good ſtrong heat to the furnace. With this heat all the quick-ſilver in the metal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently evaporates and flies up, as we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, into the top of the Limbeck or earthern veſſell, where being refrigerated by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter of a colder ſubſtance, it quickly thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens again, and diſtils downwards by the ſides of the Limbeck, like the ſmoak or vapour of a pot covered and ſeething on the fire; and by certain Retorts or pipes framed conveniently in the head or upper part of the ſaid Limbeck or earthen veſſel, it is not permitted to fall right down again, but diverted another way,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170201:112"/>
and received apart by it ſelf. The ſilver in the mean time remaining entire upon the furnace, without changing form, but yet abating much of its weight, by reaſon of the abſence of the mercury, which is now flown quite away. They ſay it abates commonly five parts of ſix in the weight: ſo that if the whole lump or loaf of ſilver and Mercury united, weigh threeſcore pound, when it is firſt ſet on the furnace, when the Mercury is ſublimated and gone, it weighs not above ten; ſo great is the diſproportion or difference in weight betwixt them.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. For the breaking and grinding of the metalls, when they are firſt taken out of the Mine, which, as we ſaid before, is a neceſſary preparative to their refining and incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the <hi>Mercury,</hi> they have many En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins or Mills, ſome whereof goe with Horſes or <hi>Bufalos</hi> in them; others are turned by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, carrying huge Peſtles in them, which beat and break the metall, after the manner of Tanne-mills. They carry commonly twelve or fourteen Peſtles apeice, and there are ſaid to be no leſs than fourty eight of theſe Mills at <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tozi,</hi> which goe by water, and thirty more which goe with Horſes, beſide a multitude of hand-Engins: at the City of <hi>Tarapaya,</hi> not farre from <hi>Potozi;</hi> there are twenty two all
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170201:112"/>
upon the water, which doe nothing elſe but grinde and break the ſilver, as in ſo many great Morters, night and day without ceaſing. When the metal is thus ſeparated from the Mercury, they count it pure and refined, whither it be gold or ſilver, and as ſuch melt it again into barres, and carry it to the Touchſtone and marking. For it is not yet ſo perfectly purified and fine, but it muſt, at leaſt in part, endure one tryall and purging more. This is done by the Aſſay-maſter, as they call him, who gives to every peice or barre of ſilver, its particular Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loy or value, according to which it muſt be ſold, and paſs for metal more or leſs fine and pure, and without which Alloy and mark gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it by the Aſſay-maſter, it is not lawfull to vend any of thoſe metalls. It's a great and rich Office at the Indies to be Aſſay-maſter, and requires likewiſe a great and exact skill in the metalls, <hi>viz.</hi> to give the true alloy and value to every peice and barre of metall that is brought. The buſineſs is done thus. They bring their metal in barres or ingots to the Aſſay-maſter or his Deputy, who cuts from every one of them a ſmall peice of metal, and weighs it exactly, marking well out of which barre or ingot every peice was cut; and then puts them one by one into ſeverall Cruſibles or Melting-pots
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170201:113"/>
which he hath ſtanding on the fire, marked every one of them according to the number of the barre, to which the peice of metall belongs, that he puts into it. Theſe Cruſibles are little ſmall veſſells made for no other purpoſe, but for the laſt trying of the metall, and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly of the aſhes of certain burnt bones, which are beaten together and caſt into a Mould. To every one of theſe ſet on the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, the Aſſay-maſter gives a ſtrong and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fire by which the metal inſtantly melts, and the Lead, Copper, Tin, or other baſer me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, in caſe there be any yet remaining in it, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves and evoporates into ſmoake, and the ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or other metal, remains in the Cruſible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, now advanced to the utmoſt perfection and fineneſs that art can give it, and withall ſo ſtrangely united and fixed in it ſelf, that though it be liquid and molten, yet they ſay, it will never ſpill nor run out, though the mouth of the Cruſible ſhould be turned downward, but abides ſtill within it, firm and fixed without looſing one drop, or the leaſt particle of its ſubſtance. When the Aſſay-maſter perceives by the colour of it (which is then fiery red) that the metal is perfectly refin'd, and that it hath evaporated all that was evoporable by fire in its ſubſtance, he takes the ſeverall Cruſibles off the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170201:113"/>
furnaces, and ſets them in ſome place, where they may conveniently cool, and then weighs every piece over again, obſerving with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull exactneſs, what every one wants of the weight which it had, when it was firſt put in, and according to the waſt, that is, according to what he finds it want, of the firſt weight: he gives the whole barre or ingot of metal the alloy, and markes it at what value or eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of purity and fineneſs it ſhall paſs. The ballance and weights which they uſe, are the moſt delicate and curious in the world, and their graines ſo ſmall, that they cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up by a mans fingers, but only with a ſmall pair of pincers, which they have on purpoſe: and they make the triall for the moſt part by candle light, that not ſo much as any ſuſpicion of winde or aire extraordinary ſhould inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene, to move the ballance one way or other. So preciſely curious are they in the buſineſs; and not altogether without cauſe, for upon the eſtimate of this little piece, the value and judgement of the whole barre, or ingot, for purity and fineneſs, dependeth, as hath been ſaid.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. I Should conclude too abruptly, and leave the report, which I pretend to make, of the wealth and riches of the New-world very imperfect; if in treating of the ſubject of metals, I ſhould forget thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and unparalled Mines at <hi>Potozi,</hi> in the Country of <hi>Peru.</hi> I confeſſe the Spaniſh wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſeem to me to be a little reſerved, and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in their reports concerning the Gold-mines of <hi>America,</hi> mentioning them onely in the generall, and not particularizing much of them one way or other; whither out of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne or no, I cannot ſay: but of theſe ſilver-mines at <hi>Potozi,</hi> they are wonderfully liberall and free, as if they meant to make them the admiration and envie of all the world beſide. And truly it is not altogether without cauſe. For doubtleſs they are one of the moſt admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things and diſcoveries of nature: a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which the Bountifull hand of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, had from the beginning laid up there
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170201:114"/>
for the Princes of the Catholique Monarchy, and for the defence of the Crown of <hi>Spain.</hi> And though it be only one mountain or hill of it ſelf, with a little hillock growing out at the foot of it, yet is it ſo infinitely rich, that it ſeemes to be all of ſilver, and would doubtleſs of it ſelf alone, be a ſufficient ſupport and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue for any Prince in Chriſtendome what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, that had it by him at home in his owne dominions. It is but one Tree, yet ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently branched and laden, that all <hi>Europe</hi> is filled with the fruit of it. In a word it is but one generall Mine, yet ſo admirably weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and good, that the treaſure of it alone, if it could be gotten, would pay three ſuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as the State maintaines, and be a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent revenue for all publick occaſions beſide. I know my ſober Reader will think I ſpeak with the largeſt, and that I uſe an huge liberty of Hyperbolizing in what I ſay; but it is not ſo, I keepe within bounds, and though I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs of my ſelf, I doe not without ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty beleeve what I report; yet I ſay no more than what very grave Authors, wiſe and ſober men, that have ſeen the place, and profeſs to ſpeake, not only of themſelves, but according to the judgement and eſtimation of men that live there, and are well experienced in the Mines,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170201:115"/>
will make good by their teſtimony. I ſhall need to name, onely <hi>Acoſta,</hi> who in his naturall Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the <hi>Indies (lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 12.) tels us, 'tis the opinion of underſtanding men in thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffaires, that there are no leſs than three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Quintalls of metal refined at <hi>Potozi</hi> every yeare; and <hi>Laet</hi> in his <hi>diſcriptio novi Orbis lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. tels me, that a Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall is a meaſure, which with the Spaniards in <hi>America</hi> containeth one hundred twenty five pound weight. Put theſe together, and the ſumme will be thirty eight Millions, five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand pound weight of ſilver melted at <hi>Potozi,</hi> yeerly. I ſuppoſe it will be ſaid, he means of Bullion or metall out of the Mine; whereof ſilver, when it is refined, makes not the third part. I grant both, being willing to give all the advantage to moderate propoſitions that I can. But let us then ſuppoſe, that every pound weight of metal out of the Mine, yeelds a <hi>Pezo,</hi> or which is leſs, but five Shillings, of fine ſilver (which I ſuppoſe no man will deny but it doth, one with another) and it will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly juſtifie what I ſay, <hi>viz.</hi> that if we had it, it would pay three ſuch Armies as the State maintains, and afford a competent reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue for all publick occaſions beſide. For it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to little leſs than ten millions of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170201:115"/>
                        <hi>viz.</hi> to nine millions three hundred and fifty thouſand pound by account; which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der favour I humbly conceive is an Income thrice as great as the State expendeth yeerly one way or other. And otherwiſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs comonly, that the Kings annuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue out of this only Mine (which is but the fifth part) is above a million one year with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Potozi</hi> is a Mountain in the country of <hi>Charcas,</hi> a Province of <hi>Peru,</hi> in the Southern part of <hi>America.</hi> It lieth about ſixty or ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty leagues diſtant from the <hi>South-Sea,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twice ſo many from the Atlantick, or Northern, (of which we ſhall ſpeak more in due place) being of a ſoil, when the Mine was firſt diſcovered, extreamly dry, hard and rocky, and every way as unpleaſant to the eye as might be; and ſo utterly barren, that it yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no kinde of commodity or fruit outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And though it lie within the Tropiques in the twenty firſt degree of latitude, yet is the aire about it very cold, and the place in the moneths of <hi>June, July,</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhowred with rain. The colour of the Soil is for the moſt part of a dark red, and the whole faſhion of the moutain ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling a pavillion or round Tent, with a

point ſharpening ſtill upwards in the manner of a Sugar-loafe; being in height from the plain ground, about a quarter of a Spaniſh league, and in the compaſs at the bottom a full league or more; and at the foot of it on the one ſide, there groweth out a leſſer hill, which the Indians call <hi>Guaina Potozi,</hi> which ſignifies the <hi>little</hi> or <hi>younger Potozi,</hi> which hath veines of good metal likewiſe, but <hi>ſtragling</hi> here and there in divers parts of the mountain, and not <hi>fixed,</hi> or running in continued branches, as thoſe of the great <hi>Potozi</hi> doe. It is a place of it ſelf, or to outward appearance, that would be thought altogether unhabitable by reaſon of the unpleaſantneſs and barrenneſs of its out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide: but its wealth within hath ſo peopled it round about, that there is not any Town at the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> of greater reſort than it, nor bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſupplied with all ſorts of things, either for neceſſity or delight, having Fleſh-meat of all ſorts, Fowle and Veniſon in aboundance, vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie of choiſe Fruits, excellent Wines, with all kinde of conſerves and other delicates beſides. The dwellings of the Spaniards and Indians, who come thither onely for pleaſure, or elſe for the gain and trading of the Mines, are ſaid to extend two or three leagues in circuit round about the foot of the hill: the Mines whereof

A certain American of <hi>Chumbivilca,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Cuſco,</hi> named <hi>Gualpa,</hi> was hunting thereabouts for veniſon; and being forced to uſe his hands to climbe up a part of the mountain that was rocky, and had ſome few buſhes growing upon it, by chance laid hold upon a little ſhrub, which grew out of a vein of the ſilver, and ſtrained himſelfe ſo much to get up, that he pulled up the branch by the roots, perceiving in the hole or place where the root grew, ſome quantity of metal; which upon better veiw and ſome experience he had of the Mines at <hi>Porco,</hi> not above ſix leagues diſtant from thence, he found to be very good: whereupon he began to look better about him, and found preſently ſcatter'd up and down on the ſurface of the earth, ſeverall other pieces of the ſame metall, but a little changed in colour, by reaſon they had lain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen (a long time perhaps) to the rain and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which yet only upon carrying to <hi>Porco,</hi> he quickly found to be good metal, and what a brave fortune he had met with by his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. And for ſome time he managed his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs warily and happily, drawing ſilver con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:170201:117"/>
out of his Mine, as much as he could deſire. But it was not long before a compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or friend of his, whoſe name was <hi>Guanca,</hi> perceived ſo much of it, that he made ſhift to become Sharer with him in the Mine: and ſo they two enjoyed for a while the richeſt Mine in the world; and might have done ſo much longer but for their own covetuouſneſs and diſſention. It happened that the part of the Mine, which this New-comer <hi>Guanca</hi> had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen proved not ſo much to his liking, as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and therefore he deſired to ſhare in common with <hi>Gualpa</hi> in his Mine; which was not better metal than the others was, but more eaſie to get forth: but <hi>Gualpa</hi> refuſed; and the other was ſo much provoked upon it, that, being but a Servant to one <hi>Villaroel</hi> a Spaniard of <hi>Porco,</hi> he preſently diſcovers the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to his Maſter: who thereupon making ſearch, and finding the metall good, and the Mine likely to be rich, immediately repaires to the Kings Officers, makes known the Mine, and procures his Servant <hi>Guanca,</hi> to be enrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led firſt diſcoverer of it, and together with him <hi>undertakes the vein,</hi> as they call it, that is, procures ſo much land about the Mine to be marked out and allotted, as the Law alloweth unto thoſe that firſt diſcover a Mine, which is
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:170201:117"/>
ſome certain yeards round about the plot, and to thoſe that will undertake to dig and ſearch it. By this means they become Lords of the Mine, having liberty to dig and draw forth the ſilver as their own, paying the King his Tribute, which is the fifth part of what they draw forth.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. There were preſently upon this three or four other principal veins of the Mine diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered upon this Mountain; of which, that which is called <hi>the rich one</hi> they report, that at firſt it ran along in a ridge, above the ſurface of the earth or plain ground, the full height of a Lance, three hundred foot together in length, and thirteen or fourteen foot broad, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likewiſe in this proportion of bounty and richneſs above fiftie or threeſcore ſtades, or ſo many times the height of a man within ground, They had digged by the year 1588. two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſtades deep into the ground, ſtill follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Mine; which becauſe it runs not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly downward, but ſloping ſomewhat in the mountain, they ſuppoſe it will be above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand or twelve hundred ſtades before they come at the root of the Mine, or the foot of the hill. This Mine yeelded at the firſt one hundred and fifty, or two hundred thouſand <hi>pezos</hi> every week into the Regiſter of the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:170201:118"/>
Contractation houſe, as they call it, and the King, by the year above-ſaid, had received out of it no leſs than a hundred millions of pieces of Aſſay, that is, if I underſtand my Author aright, ſo many millions of ſuch pieces as they carrie to the Aſſay-maſter, to be tryed and marked by him, when it is refined: which helps well to verifie what he ſaith in another place, that in the Fleet of the year 1587, in which <hi>Acoſta,</hi> came from the Indies, there came along with it eleven millions of Treaſure, of which neer the one half belonged to the King. The labour in theſe Mines, as I intimated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is exceſſively difficult and hard, the Aire they have very groſs, extreme cold and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſome for any body not uſed to it: they work night and day without ceaſing, only by Candle-light, without other knowledge or diſtinction of day and night, ſave what they gather by their work, or by their wearines, and deſire to be at reſt. But that which ſeems moſt grievous of all is the labour and danger of carrying the metal out of the Mines; which they doe thus. They have Ladders of three branches or rows, made of Neats hides, ſo ſtrongly twiſted in thongs, that it yeelds not to wood for ſtrength or toughneſs, and ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to endure the aire of the Mines longer
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170201:118"/>
than wood would doe; theſe are commonly ten ſtades high, and at the foot of them there is a kinde of Scaffold or ſtage built in form of a Gallery, with ſeats and other conveniences, to reſt upon. The rows of the Ladders are ſo framed together with wood, &amp; at ſuch diſtance, that, if occaſion be, they may both mount and deſcend together. Every man carries the weight of fifty or threeſcore pound of metal upon his back, tyed up in a Wallet or cloath, in ſuch manner caſt over and faſtened to his head, as he is ſure enough for loſing his charge, and the whole weight of the metal reſteth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſhoulders behinde. They mount com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly three and three together, the fore-man carrying the light, which is a candle ſo faſtened to the thumb of one of his hands, as he may uſe all the other part of his hand to hold by; which is more than needs. For many times, in ſuch great altitude, going or coming, their hold ſlips, or by ſome other miſchance, the poor Miners come to the ground ſooner than they would, loſing their lives by the fall, or at leaſt are ſo maimed and broken with it, that many times death were better than life to them. This was at firſt the manner of working and laboring in the Mines at <hi>Potozi,</hi> till they had digged in ſeveral veins above two hundred
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170201:119"/>
ſtades deep within ground: Since that time, to remedie the inconveniences and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that came by carrying out the metal at the Top of the Mine in ſo great an height, they have invented <hi>Soccabons,</hi> as they call them, which are certain counter-Mines, as it were, wrought in from the ſides or lower parts of the mountain, in a level line towards that part of the mountain where the vein of the metal runs, and to which the Mine that was begun at the top is brought. By this means they enter the Mines now to work, and export the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal with much more eaſe, and leſs danger than formerly, both at <hi>Potozi</hi> and all other places generally, where there are Mines. Theſe <hi>Soc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabons,</hi> or croſs-Mines, are commonly about eight or ten foot in bredth, and ſomewhat more than a ſtade in height; which they keep ſhut at ſeveral places with dores, for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the paſſage. One of them, <hi>viz.</hi> that which was made to meet <hi>the rich vein,</hi> as they call it, is ſaid to have been above twenty yeers in the digging and making; containing well nigh three hundred yards in length, before it came at the vein of metal; in all which way they were forced to make their paſſage and work through the hard and flinty bowels of the mountain, with exceſſive toyle and labour;
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:170201:119"/>
and the <hi>Soccabons</hi> of the other Mines coſt not much leſs either of time or pains: So great charges, pains, and peril, are men content to be at for a thing of naught; for that which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, for the moſt part to them, but an inſtrument of trouble, vexation, and ſin.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Something muſt be ſaid likewiſe (before we leave this ſubject) of the Jemmes and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, that are found at the <hi>New World,</hi> they being ſo conſiderable a part of the riches and wealth of it. Theſe are chiefly (at leaſt for ought I yet perceive) Emralds and Pearls; of which there is ſo great plenty at the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> that the aboundance of them makes them the leſs eſteemed, verifying herein a pretty paſſage of ſtorie, reported to have happened betwixt a Spaniard of the <hi>Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> and an Italian in <hi>Italy.</hi> The Spaniard was newly come from <hi>America</hi> richly fraighted, having brought over with him, amongſt other things of value, a great quantity of fair and goodly Emralds; whereof ſhewing one (a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fair ſtone) to the Italian, who he knew had skill, and uſed to deale in ſuch commodities, he asked what it was worth? The Italian, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſight of it, anſwered roundly, he thought it worth one hundred Duckets. Being ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed another of more exquiſite luſtre and form,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:170201:120"/>
he prized it at three hundred: Whereupon the Spaniard, having good ſtore of them, and tickled with hopes of extraordinary gain by them, would needs carrie the Merchant home to his lodging, and ſhewed him a casket full of them. The Italian ſeeing ſuch a quantity of them together, Sir, ſaid he, If you have ſuch ſtore, I will give you crowns apiece for them, and they will not be worth much more either to you or me: intimating thereby, that ſtones are chiefly eſtimated according to the raritie and ſcarſneſs of them: which was very true, though it grieved the Spaniard not a little. The Emrald, according to the report of <hi>Pliny,</hi> if it be a right and perfect ſtone of that kinde, is the moſt pleaſant and delightſome Jem to the eye that is, of an exquiſite verdure or green colour; yea, they ſay, it is not only agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and pleaſeth the ſight very much, but that it attracts it alſo with a ſtrange kinde of effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie, ſo as a man ſeems not ſatisfied with look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it, but deſires to view it ſtill more and more; that it fortifieth the facultie vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and reſtoreth it when it is dim and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed by overmuch attent looking upon any thing: and therefore Lapidaries, and men that cut or engrave fine ſtones, have uſually ſome of them lying by them, only to refreſh and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:170201:120"/>
revive their ſight, when they perceive it fail them, or grow weak at any time. To which end, <hi>viz.</hi> the better to pleaſe and affect the ſight, they are ſhap'd or cut, for the moſt part with ſome hollowneſs in them, whereby the <hi>viſual rayes,</hi> as they are called, being united and ſtrengthened one with another, doe give the greater luſtre. They are ſaid to appear both fairer and bigger at a diſtance, nor doe they change or abate their luſtre, either for Sun, ſhade, candle-light, or otherwiſe, as moſt of the other ſorts of Jemmes uſually doe, more or leſs: and as they are commonly of the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo are they not much under the value of a Diamond, if they be of the beſt and perfect ſort of Emralds: For all are not ſuch. There are ſome of ſo exquiſite and admirable luſtre, as nothing can be deſired more; in others the green is more dark and clowded: and laſtly, ſome are ſpotted; but thoſe are commonly held to be counterfeit. Thoſe which the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate <hi>Cortez,</hi> after the conqueſt of <hi>Mexico,</hi> preſented to his new Spouſe, the Lady <hi>Jane Zuniga,</hi> were extraordinary, and thought to be the rareſt in the World. They were five of them, of moſt exquiſite colour and perfection; and of ſuch bigneſs, that they were wrought into ſeveral figures and ſhapes of things: <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <pb n="222" facs="tcp:170201:121"/>
one in the faſhion of a Coronet, or little Crown; another of a Roſe, fair and great; the third was like to a Fiſh, with the eyes of gold, counted an admirable piece of Indian work; the fourth was wrought in the faſhion of a Bell, having for its clapper a great and rich pearl, engraven round about with this Motto, <hi>Sea Bendito qui te criava,</hi> in Engliſh, <hi>Bleſſed is he that created thee;</hi> the fifth was like a Cup, with the foot and brim of gold, and four little chains of gold, all joyning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at the top or cover of it, in a great pearl. 'Tis ſaid that the Merchants of <hi>Genoa</hi> offered no leſs ſumme than 40000. Duckets for one of them, which they would have preſented to the great Turk; but were refuſed: And though I confeſs there be ſome of much greater bigneſs mentioned in <hi>Pliny,</hi> yet doubtleſs theſe were very rare ſtones both for bigneſs, workmanſhip, and perfection. They grow uſually in other ſtones like to Chryſtal, and the greateſt plenty of them is in the new Kingdom of <hi>Granada,</hi> and in the Province of <hi>Veragua,</hi> and eſpecially about the Citties of <hi>Manta</hi> and <hi>Port Vieil;</hi> where there is a whole Country, or little Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, which they call <hi>de las Eſmaldas,</hi> or <hi>the Land of Emralds,</hi> from the aboundance of them, that are ſuppoſed to be there, and which
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:170201:121"/>
the Spaniards had not yet ſubdued, when my Author wrote: and they ſend uſually three or four hundred weight of this kinde of Jemmes only into <hi>Spain,</hi> one yeer with another.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Of Pearls, which anciently were counted the only Jemme, both for price and excellency, and ſuch as Princes only, and perſons of very noble quality uſed, there is ſuch plenty of them at the new World, that the very Negro Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, or She ſlaves, are ſaid to weare Chains and Bracelets of them. Theſe grow in Oyſters, or a certain ſhel-Fiſh much reſembling Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and bearing that name; and are fetcht up from the bottom of the Sea by the poor Indians that are forced to dive for them. 'Tis true, the Indians, through neceſſity and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, are become wonderfully apt and ready at this work, even almoſt beyond beleefe. They will deſcend commonly ten or twenty fathom deep into the water, and ſtay there an houre, or the better part of an houre, plucking the ſhel-fiſhes from the hard Rocks, or ſearching for them in the gravelly corners and chinks under water, till they have filled the ſatchels or baggs which they carried down with them; or that want of breath enforceth them to come up. Howbeit if the Sea be very deep, or not calm, they finde much difficultie to
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:170201:122"/>
abide under water, and therefore tye common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly certain ſtones of good weight about them, only to keep them down, which are exceeding painfull to them all the time they are under water, beſide the danger they are in to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the Tyburons, and other preying fiſhes, whiles they are there. But when they have a minde to come up, 'tis but unlooſing of the ſtones, and they mount preſentiy, being counted the moſt expert Swimmers in the World: To which likewiſe their own dry, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd, and lean complexions doe diſpoſe them very much; being, for the moſt part, of very thin and ſpare bodies, and dyeted on purpoſe for this ſervice, with the dryeſt meat which their hard Maſters can procure for them, and that alſo in ſmall quantity and with but ſcant allowance. The Pearls differ much from one another, both in faſhion, colour, bigneſs, and poliſhing, and they ſeldom finde two of them altogether alike: when they doe, it much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunceth the price and eſtimation of them, even where they are moſt common; a pair of ſuch Pearls having been valued, at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies themſelves, at a thouſand Duckets. They are counted the moſt excellent which are of an Orient white colour, bright and cleer, like the fineſt Allom, bigge, weighty, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:170201:122"/>
if they be round; which is counted ſuch a ſingular raritie in this Gem, that <hi>Oviedo</hi> tells us of himſelf, he once bought a Pearl at the Indies, not much bigger than the pellet of ſome Croſs bow, for which he gave 650. times the weight of it in good gold, upon no other ſpecial account, but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was round. They fiſh for Pearls upon all the coaſts of <hi>America,</hi> and the Iſlands ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally more or leſs, but eſpecially in the South-Sea about <hi>Panama</hi> and the Iſland <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garita,</hi> ſo called from the aboundance of them which they have found there: and in the North-Sea, about the Iſlands of <hi>Cumana, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bagna, Rio de la Hacha,</hi> and other places, which are commonly found bigger than thoſe of the South Sea. And although it be the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſome, grounded upon the covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Spaniards, when they firſt came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe parts (who ſpared not the very feed or mother of the Pearl it ſelf, but ſwept &amp; took all that came to hand) that the profit of Pearl-fiſhing is much decayed, of what it was; yet if it be true what the ſame <hi>Oviedo</hi> tells us, I ſhould think it may be otherwiſe, and the trade good ſtill. For he ſaith, Theſe Pearl-Oyſters come by ſhoals ſucceſſively into the places where they are uſually taken; and that
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:170201:123"/>
though a bank in the Sea be ſwept never ſo clean of them by the Pearl-fiſhers, yet not far off they finde alwaies more, and likewiſe in the ſame place good plenty of them again in a ſhort time.</p>

                        <p>Of <hi>Eſtotiland,</hi> and the ſeveral Provinces which it containeth.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THe firſt Province of the Continent of <hi>America</hi> towards the North, is called <hi>Eſtotiland;</hi> for what reaſon I muſt plainly confeſs, I cannot ſo cleerly diſcover; unleſs perhaps our Neighbours the Duch happened to have the firſt naming of it, and that it beareth any ſignification of its Eaſterly lying in reſpect of the other Provinces. It containeth all thoſe Regions of the Mexican or Northern part of <hi>America,</hi> which lye fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt toward the North Eaſt: on which ſide, as likewiſe more directly Eaſtward, it is waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all along with the main Ocean, or North-Sea; having on the South <hi>Canada,</hi> or <hi>new France:</hi> Weſtward, and to the North-weſt, it is not yet fully diſcovered: but ſuppoſed either to be joyned to ſome parts of <hi>Tartary,</hi> or (which I think is the more common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture to be divided from it by the Sea: which ſome, preſuming it to be but a narrow Sea, call <hi>the Streits of Anian,</hi> from a Province or part of the <hi>Aſiatique Tartary,</hi> which beareth
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:170201:127"/>
that name, and lyeth upon it. On the North it hath a Bay, or large Inlet of the Sea, which the Engliſh call <hi>Hudſons Streites</hi> from Capt. <hi>Henry Hudſon</hi> an Engliſhman, who in the yeare 1610 is ſaid to have ſailed in this Sea no leſs then three hundred leagues Weſtward, in ſearch of a paſſage that way to the Kingdomes of <hi>Catha</hi> and <hi>China;</hi> of which we have ſpoken already, and which was ſo much endeavoured in thoſe times both by our ſelves and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours the Duch: but without ſucceſs hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. The whole Province containeth theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Countries, if I may ſo call them, or Prefectſhips, as ſome others doe, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotiland</hi> more properly ſo called. Secondly, <hi>Terra Corterialis.</hi> Thirdly, New-found land, and Fourthly certain Iſlands neer adjoyning to the Continent, which they call <hi>Bacca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leos.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Eſtotiland</hi> ſpecially ſo called, is the moſt Northerly region of all <hi>America</hi> towards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> lying betwixt the aboveſaid <hi>Hudſons Sreights,</hi> which it hath on the <hi>North,</hi> and <hi>Terra Corterialis</hi> on the <hi>South.</hi> The ſoil of the country is ſaid to be reaſonably good, and well ſtored with naturall Commodities, I mean, ſuch as are of neceſſity and may be expected in ſuch a cold northerly quarter, as Fleſh, fowl,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:170201:127"/>
and good ſtore of Fiſh in the Sea. Among the Natives of the country there, and ſome Savage that live wild up and down in the Woods, and go naked, not withſtanding the extream cold: but for the moſt part, they are ſuppoſed at leaſt to be more civill. The firſt diſcoverers of the country reporting of them, that they both ſow corn, brew Beer and Ale, uſe <hi>Canoas</hi> or little Boats at Sea, by which they trade with <hi>Greenland, Freezland,</hi> and other parts at one thouſand or five hundred miles diſtance from them. They are ſaid likwiſe to have ſome uſe of letters, but of a Character proper only to their own Nation, and not underſtood by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people beſide themſelves. Yea they talk likewiſe, as if they had ſome knowledge of the Latin tongue; and of certain Latin books in a Library of one of the Kings of the Country: wherein, if there be any thing of truth, (as I hold it not altogether impoſſible) 'tis likely, ſome people from the more Northerly parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> that underſtood the Latin tongue, might in times paſt be caſt on ſhore, or ſuffer Shipwrack upon thoſe Coaſts; where being conſtrained to live and abide, they might leave ſome books, and other monuments of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage behind them in the Country after their deceaſe. However it be, this ſeems more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:170201:128"/>
by the report and experience of ſome Engliſh, that the people are generally here found to be more ingenious, to have better judgement in things, and to be much more skilfull in divers Mechanicall arts, then uſually in theſe other parts of <hi>America</hi> they were at firſt. Among other things they were obſerved to uſe a kinde of Dart, or ſhort Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velin, pointed with bright ſteel and very ſharp: which being a kinde of Weapon uſed only by the people of <hi>Java,</hi> and ſome other of the Iſlands of the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> it is conjectured, that they have commerce one with another: which ſeems not altogether improbable. But as for the Towns, Citties and great Caſtles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, which ſome ſpeak of, and of the Temples, wherein they ſacrificed men, (though that be an ancient and generall cuſtome among the Americans, and thoſe of this Country bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous enough to doe it) yet the Reader per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps will be willing to ſuſpend his beleefe a while: as likewiſe he will, for the ſuppoſed Mines of gold and ſilver there: of which (at leaſt as it may ſeem) the Northerly ſcituation of the Country doth not well permit us to have ſuch ſtrong preſumption. Of Braſs and Iron, 'tis likely enough there may be good ſtore, if the Country were ſcarched. But as
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:170201:128"/>
yet the knowledge thereof, eſpecially concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the more Inland parts; remains very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect. Some Engliſh Adventurers paſſing that way, have left names to certain Capes or Head-lands upon the Northern Coaſts of it, and that is all: the chief of which are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Cape <hi>Elizabeth</hi> at the entrance into <hi>Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Streights</hi> Northward. Prince <hi>Henries</hi> Foreland. Cape <hi>Charles.</hi> Kings Foreland with with divers others, more to the <hi>South.</hi> Cape <hi>Woſtenholme</hi> and <hi>Digges</hi> his Iſland about the mouth of the Streight; where it opens it ſelf and diſembogues into a large and capacious Bay, called (as aboveſaid) <hi>Hudſons Bay,</hi> and dividing theſe uttermoſt Provinces of the Northern <hi>America</hi> into two parts, which ſome call the Eaſtern and Weſtern point; as may be ſeen in the Maps. The people of the Country, that are any thing civilized, cloath themſelves commonly with Beaſts skins, and with the skins of the Sea-calves otherwiſe called <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> which are a kinde of Fiſh of an Amphibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nature, much abounding in thoſe Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Seas, of the bigneſs of a young Heifer, or Bullock of two yeares old, which they hunt and take in great numbers, eſpeciall where the Whale-fiſhing is not ſo good; and draw a good quantity of oile from them, which they
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:170201:129"/>
call <hi>Train-oile,</hi> as they doe from the Whale. The fleſh of them is counted reaſonable good meat, of a taſte ſomewhat like Porke: and on each ſide of their upper Jaw there groweth out a long tooth, or Tusk, crooked and ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding downward, not unlike to that of an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, each of them a Cubit long ſometimes and more, of a ſubſtance white and very hard like Ivory; for which it commonly paſſeth. And it were well, if the deceit reſted there, and went no further. For as it ſeems, there are ſome that vend it for Unicorns horn and attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute I know not what ſtrange and ſovereign vertues to it. An egregious impoſture, of which the learned Doctor <hi>Brown</hi> doth likewiſe (as his manner is) acutely and kindly admoniſh us. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>chap.</hi> 23. of his <hi>Pſudodox.

                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Terra Corterialis</hi> is a Province, or Country of this Northern part of <hi>America,</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Southward of <hi>Eſtotiland,</hi> and Northward of <hi>New-France</hi> or <hi>Canada,</hi> being ſo named from <hi>Gaſpar Corterialis</hi> a Portugheſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who in the yeare 1500 or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts firſt diſcovered theſe parts, and gave name to the Country; but did not much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. For returning the next yeare after, with intention to make a further diſcovery, 'tis ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:170201:129"/>
he was ſhipwracke and drown'd at Sea together with his company; of whom, as <hi>Oſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> in his hiſtory of <hi>Portugall,</hi> witneſſeth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any returned or were heard of: and the like misfortune befell his Brother <hi>Michael Corteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alis</hi> the next yeare after; who ſetting out two Ships to ſearch and enquire of, concerning the fortunes of his Brother <hi>Gaſpar,</hi> periſhed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in his deſign, being himſelf loſt and all his men: upon which diſaſters the Portugheſes quite give over the Country, and the French ſucceed them, naming the Country <hi>New Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> in reference to <hi>Bretain</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> which it ſeemes, was their native Country. This was about the year 1504. The ſoil of this Country is very luſty and good, for all ſorts of grain ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, and yeelds a great advantage to the Husbandman, but not without good pains ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the tillage and managing of it: For which reaſon it is called by ſome <hi>Terra di la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brador,</hi> or the land that requires Labourers; in alluſion perhaps to <hi>Terra di lavora,</hi> or the Country of <hi>Campania</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> ſo called from a like property. The people of the Country, of themſelves barbarous and ſavage enough, are ſaid to be civilized and bettered in their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by the converſation of the French. They live much upon Fiſh, are excellent Archers,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:170201:130"/>
jealous of their Wives, and dwell for the moſt part in Caves under ground; beeing alſo much given to Soothſaying &amp; Divining; further than which they ſeem not to have much knowledge, or ſence of any thing that concerns religion. The Country was firſt of all diſcovered by Sir <hi>Sebaſtion Cabot,</hi> at the charges of <hi>Henery</hi> the ſeventh, King of <hi>England,</hi> as hath been ſaid; but it was only diſcovered, and the deſign laid wholly aſide, by reaſon of ſome domeſtick troubles, and a Warre which the King then had with the Scots: whereupon the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comers tooke leave to enter. The Towns or places, which the French have built ſince, are cheifly, 1. <hi>Breſt,</hi> 2. <hi>St. Marie,</hi> and 3. <hi>Cabo Marzo,</hi> as they call it; of which there is little more to be ſaid.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Terra Nova,</hi> or <hi>New-found land,</hi> the third part of this Northerly Province of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> is a great Iſland, lying on the <hi>South</hi> of <hi>Corterialis,</hi> from which it is divided by a Frith, or narrow Sea, which the French call <hi>Golf de Chaſtieux.</hi> This place is chiefly frequented for fiſhing; of which there is ſuch plenty all along the Coaſts of this Iſland, and likewiſe of <hi>Terra Corterialis</hi> adjoyning to it, that the huge Shoales of Cod-fiſh doe ſometimes ſtay their Ships under ſail: beſides great ſtore of other
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:170201:130"/>
fiſh, both of ſalt water and freſh, as namely Herrings, Salmons, Thornback, Smelts, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Oyſters, and Muſcles that are ſaid to have a kinde of Pearl in them; but of what quality or value, doth not ſo well appear. The Land within is likewiſe reported to be a very good Countrie, plentifully ſtored with Deer and other ſorts of Veniſon, Pheſants, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges, Swans, with variety of other good Fowl; laſtly of a temperate Aire and Soile, not barren: only the people of it are ſaid to be few, and to inhabit chiefly the Weſtern and North-weſt parts of it. But this perhaps may be rather out of fear, and to avoid the converſation of Strangers; which at firſt they would not endure but fled at the ſight of them, being themſelves altogether Savage and wilde. But ſince 'tis ſaid, they grow more tractable, and will be hired, in time of yeer, by the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugheſes, and other Nations that fiſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly for Whales in the Bay of St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> and other places thereabouts, to help them in the opening of their Whales, boyling the fiſh, and drawing out the Oyle; wherein they that will be got to it, are extremely diligent and ready to take pains. They are commonly of but mean ſtature, full eyed, ſomewhat broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, and for the moſt part beardleſs. Their
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:170201:131"/>
houſes are only certain long Poles, ſet an end ſloping upwards towards the top, where they are faſtened together, and covered down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with the skins of Beaſts, having in the mid'ſt their hearth, or place to make fire upon. But that which is moſt remarkable about this Iſland, is the many and fair Havens which it affordeth on all ſides for ſhipping: in which reſpect it is though, for the bigneſs, ſcarſely to be paralleld by any other Iſland or Place in the World: not indeed beautified with any great Towns, or ſtately buildings, as ſome are, but affording commodious and ſecure ſtation for the talleſt ſhips that come before it; the chief whereof are theſe: 1. <hi>La Roigneuſe,</hi> or <hi>Rennoſa,</hi> as it is called, ſix leagues Northward of the <hi>Cape Raye,</hi> which lyeth at the South-Eaſt angle of the Iſland; a place much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted unto for fiſhing, from all parts. 2. <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus formoſus,</hi> or the fair Haven, three miles Northward of the other; capable of great ſhips, and bearing at leaſt four or five miles within Land, or more. 3. <hi>Thornbay,</hi> called otherwiſe by the Portugheſes <hi>Enſeada grande,</hi> or the great Bay, for diſtinction ſake. 4. <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity Bay,</hi> on the North of the Cape <hi>St. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> called by the Spaniards <hi>Baia de la concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> This is likewiſe a very large and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170201:131"/>
Bay, five miles over, where it is narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, having diverſe great Rivers falling into it, and ſome little Iſlands lying ſcatteringly up and down in it, yet ſafe, and affording very good Anchorage and riding for ſhips in moſt parts. 5. <hi>Bay Blanche,</hi> as the French call it, or White-Bay, on the North of the Cape or Promontory of <hi>St. John.</hi> On the South ſide of the Iſland, and Weſtward of <hi>Cape Raye,</hi> there is, 1. <hi>Port Treſpaſſe,</hi> an excellent and ſecure Harbour, having alwaies a reaſonable deep Sea, without ſhallows or Rocks. 2. <hi>Port St. Marie,</hi> ſix leagues diſtant from it. 3. <hi>Port Preſenza,</hi> by others called <hi>Placenza,</hi> on the other ſide of Cape <hi>St. Marie,</hi> towards the Weſt. 4. <hi>Port du Baſques,</hi> or the Biſcayners Haven; and laſtly on the Weſt ſide of the Iſland, after you have doubled <hi>Cape Raye,</hi> there is at <hi>Georges Bay,</hi> all of them ſecure ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, large and of great reſort.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Before this Iſland, right over againſt <hi>Cape Ray,</hi> at a diſtance of twenty four leagues or more, there lyeth an huge Bank or ridge of Land, extending it ſelf in length, out of the Sea, ſome hundred of leagues, if my Author miſtake not; but in bredth not above four or five and twenty, when it is broadeſt: and in other parts much leſs, ſharpning towards
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:170201:132"/>
each end into a Conus or narrow point. It is counted one of the Marveils of the Sea; which round about it, at ſome diſtance, is very deep, and hardly to be ſounded, eſpecially betwixt <hi>the Bank,</hi> (for ſo they commonly call it) and <hi>Cape Ray,</hi> but drawing neerer it grows by degrees more and more ſhallow; inſomuch that nigh the Land, there is not much more water than is neceſſary for the ſhips riding. It runneth out in length, as was ſaid, from North to South, from fourty one degrees of latitude to fiftie two; and round about it there lye ſcattered a multitude of leſſer Iſlands; which Sir <hi>Sebaſtian Cabot,</hi> when he firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, the place called by one common name <hi>Los Baccaleos,</hi> or the Iſlands of Cod-fiſh, from the great quantity of that ſort of fiſh hee there found: which was ſuch, that they hindred the paſſage of his ſhips, and lay in ſuch multitudes upon the Coaſts, that the very Bears would come and catch them in their claws, and draw them to Land. This place, I ſay, with the reſt was firſt diſcovered by Sir <hi>Sebaſtian Cabot,</hi> upon the Engliſh account; howbeit the matter happened to be lay'd aſide upon the aforeſaid occaſions; till in King <hi>Henery</hi> the eight his time, it was revived again by <hi>Thorn</hi> and <hi>Eliot,</hi> two Merchants of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi>
                        <pb n="245" facs="tcp:170201:132"/>
but without ſucceſs: after which the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheſes, French, and other Nations, reſort to it and change the names which the firſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers had given to the Bayes and Capes thereabouts. But the Engliſh not relinquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their pretenſions of primier diſcovery and ſeiſin, about the yeer 1583 Sir <hi>Humfry Gilbert</hi> took poſſeſſion of it again, in the name of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and prohibited all Nations the liberty of fiſhing there, without the Queen of <hi>Englands</hi> leave. But he being unhappily wracked in his coming home, the buſineſs was again diſcontinued for a time, <hi>viz.</hi> till the year 1608, when it was undertaken a new by <hi>John Guy,</hi> another Merchant of <hi>Briſtoll;</hi> and with ſo good ſucceſs, that the Colony in a ſhort time were well furniſhed with Wheat, Rye, Barley, and other grain of their own ſowing, with Turnips, Coleworts, and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of other neceſſary things, not without ſome probable hopes of Metals, a certain and plentifull trade of Sables, Musk, and other rich Commodities, and ſuch excellent good fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, eſpecially for Codfiſh and Ling, that 'tis ſaid ſome Engliſh-men doe ordinarily take two or three hundred of them in the ſpace of three or four houres; which from thence they
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:170201:133"/>
conveigh, as a ſure and ready Merchandiſe, into moſt parts of <hi>Europe.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1 <hi>CAnada,</hi> or <hi>New France,</hi> is a large Province of this Northern part of <hi>America,</hi> bounded Northward with <hi>Terra Corterialis</hi> aboveſaid, and on the South with that part of <hi>Virginia</hi> which is called <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> on the Eaſt it is waſhed with the Ocean or North Sea; the Weſtern borders of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not yet fully diſcovered or known. It hath its name from the River <hi>Canada,</hi> which wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth the whole Province, running through the mideſt of it, and is counted one of the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and greateſt Rivers of <hi>America;</hi> where yet it is ſupppoſed there are the faireſt and greateſt of all the World beſide. It hath its head or ſpring in thoſe undiſcovered parts of this Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly tract, which remain yet unknown; and runs generally with a large and violent ſtream, having in it many Cataracts, or falls of the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:170201:133"/>
Water, as it were, from ſome Rocks lying in the channels which renders the paſſage of it up the ſtream extremely difficult, and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards no leſs dangerous. In ſome places it ſwells and ſpreads it ſelf out into large and huge Lakes, containing, ſome of them, one hundred miles in compaſs, and having diverſe ſmall Iſlands ſcattered up and down in them: after which it is preſently again reduced into a narrower channel, of a league or two leagues broad generally. Thus it runneth turning and winding up and down the Country, as 'tis ſuppoſed, ſome hundred of leagues from its head-ſpring; till at laſt having received into its channel many leſſer Rivers of the Countrie, it empties it ſelf into a great Bay, which they call the Bay of St. <hi>Lawrence;</hi> being at the mouth no leſs thin thirty or fourty leagues broad, as it is ſaid, and one hundred and fifty fathom deep of water. The French Authors report, that it hath been actually ſearched for above one thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles and upward from the Bay: and that the Savages living thereabouts, doe ſpeak confidently, of certain Bayes of Salt-water more towards the South; and of great veſſels which they have ſeen that way: which, if true, muſt neceſſarily be from the South Sea. But I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:170201:134"/>
not that any farther enquiry hath been made by them about it; as doubtleſs a buſineſs of ſo great importance would deſerve, <hi>viz.</hi> to finde ſuch a commodious and eaſie paſſage into the South Sea, and thereby to the other Indies. Therefore I ſuppoſe thoſe relations are not much credited. The Countrie on both ſides the River, is reaſonably pleaſant and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, eſpecially on the South or South-weſt of it; where it ſeemeth to be a little mountai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, the ground aſcending, for the moſt part upwards from the River, and riſing with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny little hills, clad moſt of them with Vines, of which there is great aboundance in the Countrie, and other trees, and divided fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with other leſſer ſtreams, which at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places doe all of them fall into the great River. In this Countrie the French hitherto, I ſuppoſe, have made the greateſt diſcoveries of any other Nation; yet not the firſt, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the tract of <hi>Corterialis</hi> and Sir <hi>Sebaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Cabot,</hi> that went before them. The whole Country containeth theſe particular Provinces, or ſubdiviſions, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>New-France,</hi> more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ſo called. 2. <hi>Nova-Scotia.</hi> 3. <hi>Norim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>begua:</hi> and 4. ſome Iſlands adjoyning.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>New-France,</hi> ſpecially ſo called, lyeth on the North-ſide of the River <hi>Canada,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:170201:134"/>
what inclining towards the Eaſt; and on the South of <hi>Terra Corterialis:</hi> but in the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern, or more inland parts, the River divideth it in the midſt, the French having ſeated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on both ſides of it. The Countrie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally aboundeth with Staggs, and other ſorts of wilde Deer, Bears, Marterns, Foxes, and Hares; of which laſt there is ſuch plenty, that the French call one of the Iſlands, <hi>Iſle aux Lieures,</hi> or the Iſland of Hares. They have likewiſe good ſtore of Conies: Fiſh and Fowl in aboundance; only they complain the Winter is long, that the Snow lyeth upon the ground ſometimes till a good part of <hi>May</hi> be paſt, and that the North-weſt winde, eſpecially in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, blows very cold there, and brings aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Snow with it. The Countrie hath very much wood; but otherwiſe of a Soile not unapt for Corne, eſpecially Pulſe, and ſuch like grain; of which it affordeth extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie increaſe. But the peculiar Commodity of the Countrie ſeems to be their Chains of <hi>Eſurgnuy,</hi> as they call it, which ſome ſay is only a kinde of ſhel-fiſh of exceeding white colour; yet found to be of ſoveraign vertue for the ſtanching of blood: in which reſpect they make both Beads and Bracelets of them, and not only uſe them, but vend them alſo as a
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:170201:135"/>
chief Commoditie; though others, as <hi>Laet,</hi> out of the Commentaries of the French-men themſelves, ſeem to report otherwiſe, and to deſcribe the uſe and making of <hi>Eſurgnuy</hi> only as a piece of ſuperſtition among the Savages, about ſome dead men. The People, when the French came firſt among them, were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rude and barbarous, as the moſt part of them continue ſtill; living generally without houſes or any certain places of abode; goe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, ſave only that they have a little piece of ſome Beaſts skin bound about their middle. Thoſe about the Sea coaſts live moſt upon fiſhing; which they practiſe in certain light boats, which at night they are able to draw to draw to Land, without much help; and but turning the bottom upward, they ſerve them for an houſe to ſleep in. The Countrie affords good plenty of <hi>Maiz</hi> in many places, but it is ſaid to be the Womens work both to digge the ground and ſow it; the Men giving themſelves to no kinde of labour, but only of hunting and fiſhing. Among many other bad enough, they are ſaid to have one vile cuſtome among them, which is, that the young Maidens, when they are fourteen or fifteen yeers old, have leave to proſtitute themſelves to all Comers; and that they marrie not uſually, till they have
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:170201:135"/>
thus ſatiated themſelves with promiſcuous luſt for the ſpace of 4 or 5 yeers together: after which, notwithſtanding they take husbands, and prove ſo extremely loving and conſtant (if a man could beleeve it) that they never marrie twice, but after their rude manner mourn for their Husbands all their life long.</p>
                     <p>They have ſome few Towns; the chief whereof are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Hochelaga,</hi> ſaid to be the ſeat and reſidence of a King of this Countrie, which at leaſt ſome of the Natives acknowledge, and exceedingly reverence, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying him ſometimes in great pomp upon their ſhoulders, ſitting upon a Carpet of Beaſts skins. This Town, if there be any ſuch (for it muſt be confeſſed, the reports concerning it are not ſo certain) is ſituate far within Land, at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of ſix or ſeaven leagues from the River <hi>Canada;</hi> and is a kinde of fortified place, encompaſſed about with a three-fold courſe of Timber-ramparts one within another, of about two Rods high from the ground, with croſs planks or pieces of Timber, laid out on purpoſe to hinder the ſcaling, or getting up, by an Enemie. Towards the top there is, as it were, a Scaffold or Gallery framed, from whence they may throw down ſtones (of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:170201:136"/>
which there is alwaies good ſtore ready) or what elſe they have to annoy the aſſaylants. It hath one only Gate for entrance, and that likewiſe well fortified, after their manner. There are ſaid to be in it fifty or threeſcore great houſes, built, (as the manner of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans generally is, that uſe houſes) in a ſquare figure, each ſide being about fiftie foot long or more, and ſixteen or twenty broad, but not many ſtories high; and in the mideſt of the Court or void ſpace, a place to make their fire, and doe other neceſſary work about it. The Countrie round about this Town pleaſant and good. 2. <hi>Stadac,</hi> or as ſome call it <hi>Stada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cone,</hi> another Town of the Natives, not far from the Iſle <hi>d' Orleance</hi> Weſtward. 3. <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beque,</hi> another old Town, which the French, having firſt expelled the Natives, and made it a Colonie of their own, have ſince named <hi>St. Croix.</hi> 4. <hi>Tadouſac,</hi> a Town lying at the mouth of the River <hi>Saguenay,</hi> having a ſmall Haven, but very ſafe, and capable of ten or twenty good ſhips. 5. <hi>France-Roy:</hi> This is little more than a Caſtle and Fort, built by <hi>Mounſieur Robeval,</hi> a French man, at his firſt landing there, about the yeer 1540. And laſtly <hi>St. Lewis,</hi> a place which the French deſigned for a Colonie, in the year 1611, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

the command of <hi>Monſieur Champlain;</hi> but it came not to effect, by reaſon of the Iroquois, a Savage and war-like People on the South-ſide of the River <hi>Canada,</hi> who doe often trouble and alarme the French in their Quarters, and particularly hindred this Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Nova-Scotia,</hi> or <hi>New-Scotland,</hi> is a part of this Province of <hi>America,</hi> ſo named by Sir <hi>William Alexander,</hi> a Scottiſh Gentleman, to whom King <hi>James</hi> gave it by Letters Patents, in the year 1621, being made afterwards Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of State for <hi>Scotland;</hi> and after that, by King <hi>Charles,</hi> Earl of <hi>Sterling.</hi> It contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all that part of the Province of <hi>Canada,</hi> or <hi>New-France,</hi> which the French call <hi>Accadie,</hi> or ſometimes <hi>Cadia,</hi> (which properly is only a <hi>Peninſula,</hi> or half Iſland lying thereabouts) together with ſo much of the main Land as lyeth between the River <hi>Canada,</hi> and the Bay <hi>Francoiſe,</hi> that is, reaching from the River of <hi>St. Croix,</hi> upon the Weſt, to the Iſle of <hi>Aſſumption</hi> in the Eaſt. This was done pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after that Sir <hi>Samuell Argall,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Virginia,</hi> had outed the French of all their poſſeſſions on the South-ſide of <hi>Canada,</hi> that is, ſuch as lay within the bounds of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia</hi> and <hi>New-England,</hi> where they had not
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:170201:137"/>
any thing to doe; much leſs to moleſt and make-warre upon ſuch people as lived quietly under the protection of the Engliſh. But the Patentee after ſometime, finding that to plant and maintain Colonies, was no buſineſs to be undertaken by a ſingle perſon, ſold <hi>Port-royall,</hi> which was the principall place he had there, to the French, and wholly diſcontinued his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours in the reſt, which the French there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have ſince poſſeſſed.</p>
                     <p>The places of chief importance in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try are, 1. <hi>Port-royall</hi> above mentioned. This was firſt a Colony of French, planted there, by <hi>Monſieur de Montz</hi> about the yeare 1604. but being deſtroyed by the Engliſh from <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia,</hi> about the yeare 1613. it was granted to Sir <hi>William Alexander;</hi> who as we heard, ſold it back again to the French, and they took poſſeſſion of it the ſecond time, and upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother account. Howbeit, if report ſpeak true, as the affaires of the world are alwais uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, it is now again very lately taken from them by ſome Engliſh, commanded by Major <hi>Sedgwick.</hi> It hath a reaſonable good Haven belonging to it, of a mile broad and more within, and two miles in length: the mouth or entrance being ſomewhat narrower, but neere upon a mile over. 2.

named by the Colony which Sir <hi>William Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> ſent thither; but by the French <hi>Port au Mouton,</hi> or Sheeps Bay. 3. <hi>Gaſpe</hi> or <hi>Gachepe,</hi> another fair Port right over againſt the Iſle of <hi>Aſſumption.</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. To the Southweſt of <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> and Nothward of <hi>Virginia,</hi> lieth the Country of <hi>Norim begua,</hi> ſo generally called, and as it hath been thought, from a great City or Town in this Province, or from a River bearing the ſame name. But as for the firſt, later diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries finde none ſuch; and as for the River that ſhould be called <hi>Norimbegua;</hi> it is likewiſe ſwallowed up in that which is more truely cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Pemtegovet:</hi> which is indeed a fair River running many miles together in this Tract, but not well navigable above twenty or thirty at the moſt, by reaſon of the Cataracts or great falls of water which it hath; and which are an inconvenience incident unto many other Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the New World, and doth make them at ſeverall places unpaſſable. The mouth of this River is ſaid to be eight or nine miles broad having many little mountainous Iſlands lying before and about it; one whereof the French call <hi>La Iſle haute,</hi> from the great height which it ſeemeth to beare to them at Sea. Weſtward of this River <hi>Pemtegovet,</hi> at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance

                     <p n="5">5. There are adjoyning to theſe parts of <hi>Canada</hi> or <hi>New-France,</hi> cerain Iſlands, which

although they come not under any one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon name, yet it ſeemes moſt fit, that we ſhould take notice of them as Appurtenances to this Country. The Principall of theſe are, 1. <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſcotec,</hi> or the Iſle of <hi>Aſſumption,</hi> ſituate in the very mouth of the great River of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</hi> It was diſcovered firſt in the yeare 1534. by <hi>Jaques Cartier</hi> a French man, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in length thirty leagues or more, but in breadth not much above ſeven or eight. The Iſland is for the moſt part very plain and level, and of a ſoil fruitfull enough if it had Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants: plentifully ſtored both with fowl and fiſh, having convenient roades but no very good harbours for Ships to ſtand and abide in. 2. <hi>Rameae.</hi> Theſe are, as it were, a Fry of Iſlets, or leſſer Iſlands, lying together in the great Gulf or Bay of Saint <hi>Lawrence,</hi> on the South-ſide of <hi>Natiſcotec;</hi> being a place much reſorted to by the French, for the <hi>Morſefiſhing</hi> in time of the year, of which we have ſpoken ſomething already. They are ſo numerous up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe Coaſts, that a ſmall French Bark, 'tis ſaid will catch one thouſand or five hundred of them in a few houres; and ſo large, fat, and unctious withall, that of the bellies of five or ſix <hi>Morſes,</hi> they make an Hogſ-head or more of <hi>Trane-oile,</hi> as good as that which they have
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:170201:139"/>
of the Whale; beſide the benefit of their fleſh, which they ſay, eſpecially if it be young, is as tender and ſweet as Veale. The skins of them they dreſs, as we doe our Oxe-hides; and they ſay, they are twice as thick and ſerviceable up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any occaſion. 3. <hi>Brion,</hi> a ſmall Iſland South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the <hi>Rameae,</hi> not above two or three leagues in length, and about ſo much likewiſe in breadth, but of a rich Soil and excellent good paſturage, though ſhaded in ſome places with many tall and lofty trees of ſeverall kindes; having another leſſer Iſland neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it, which they call <hi>Iſle Blanche,</hi> or the white Iſland, of like fertility with it ſelf. 4. <hi>Inſula Britonum,</hi> or <hi>Iſle Breton,</hi> called alſo ſometimes the Iſle of Saint <hi>Lawrence.</hi> This lyeth to the South-Eaſt of the Iſle <hi>Brion,</hi> of a Triangular forme, containing about eighty leagues in compaſs, mountainous for a great part of it and rugged, but in the Valleys more fruitfull and pleaſant; having no Rivers, at leaſt not any that are much known, but inſtead thereof, embraced much with armes of the Sea, and thereby not unlik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be well ſtored with fiſh upon the Coaſts of it. In the midſt of the Country there is a great Lake, which containes within it many leſſer Iſlands. The Woods well repleniſhed
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:170201:139"/>
with moſt ſorts of Deere, a kinde of black Foxes, and aboundance of the American Birds, which they call <hi>Pengwins.</hi> The chief Port, or Haven of it is New-port, called by the French <hi>Port aux Anglois,</hi> becauſe much frequented by the Engliſh in regard of the fiſhing. Laſtly, there is the Iſle <hi>de Sable,</hi> ſo called by the French, as 'tis ſuppoſed, from the Sands which lye ſo much about it, containing about fifteen leagues in compaſs, and diſtant from <hi>Breton-Iſle</hi> not much leſs than twenty or thirty lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues; held to be of an unſafe landing, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſaid ſands lying about it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though the planting of it hath been twice attempted by the French, and once by the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugheſes, yet the buſineſs never had ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>The Inland parts of this whole country of <hi>Canada,</hi> are ſtill in the hands of the Savages or Natives, and not much diſcovered further than to know the names of the people: the chief whereof that occurre, are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Iro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quois,</hi> a ſtout and warlike people on the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt of <hi>Norimbegua,</hi> often moleſting the French. The <hi>Souriquois</hi> and <hi>Etechemins</hi> in the Country of <hi>Accadie,</hi> or <hi>New-Scotland,</hi> who are more their friends, and doe help them ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times againſt the <hi>Iroquois.</hi> Beſide on the banks, and about the River of <hi>Canada,</hi> there are the

                        <hi>Algoumequins,</hi> the <hi>Algoiugequins, Quenon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gebins, Attagopautans,</hi> and many other Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagnets of ſuch harſh names, that we ſhould be enforced almoſt to paſs them over in ſilence, though they otherwiſe deſerv'd to be named: only this we may obſerve in the general, of the Savages of theſe parts of <hi>America, viz.</hi> That as ignorant and barbarous as they are, yet they have made ſhift to diſcover the Factions, Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and Enmities than are amongſt the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean People that come thither; and are able to make ſuch advantage of it, by ſiding ſome of them with the one, and ſome with the other, that they all preſerve their liberty by it: So that as yet the footing which either the French, Engliſh, or any other Nation have among them, ſeems rather to be for the ſecurity of their own abode and trading where they live, than to give them any abſolute right of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; much leſs any general command of the Countrie.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>VIrginia,</hi> ſo named by Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> about the year 1584, in honour of our Maiden Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> of famous Memorie, is a fair Province of this Northern part of <hi>America;</hi> bounded on the North with <hi>Canada,</hi> on the Eaſt with the Sea called <hi>Mare del Nort,</hi> on the South with <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida;</hi> the Weſtern confines of it being not yet known; but ſuppoſed, and perhaps not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther improbably, to extend themſelves as far as the South Sea. The more inland parts of the Countrie are mountainous and ſomewhat barren; but otherwiſe thick ſet with Woods, and thoſe as well repleniſhed with wild Beaſts, Veniſon, and a ſort of People, not much leſs wilde and ſavage than Beaſts: the Maritime parts more plain and fruitfull. The whole Countrie extends it ſelf from North to South, that is to ſay, from the Southermoſt parts of <hi>Norimbega</hi> to <hi>Florida,</hi> full ten degrees of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, <hi>viz.</hi> from thirty four to fourty four, containing thereby incluſively ſix hundred
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:170201:141"/>
common or Engliſh miles: being ſub-divided into three inferiour Provinces or Parts, which are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>New-England,</hi> 2. <hi>Novum-Belgium,</hi> or <hi>Neiw-Nederlands,</hi> as our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours call it. And 3. <hi>Virginia,</hi> properly ſo called: to which, becauſe it is an Engliſh Plantation, and a part of this Weſtern World, it ſhall not be amiſs to add the <hi>Bermudae</hi> Iſlands.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>New-England</hi> is that part of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>America</hi> which lyeth next to <hi>Canada,</hi> or <hi>New France,</hi> by which it is bordered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North, Eaſtward with <hi>Norimbegua,</hi> on the South and South-weſt with <hi>Niew-Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlande:</hi> the other borders, that is, directly Weſtward, remaining yet unknown. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trie lyeth about the middle of the Temperate Zone, betwixt the degrees of fourty one and fourty four, being naturally of the ſame degree of heat with <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> parallel to which it lyeth in the Weſtern Hemiſphere; but yet theſe heats ſo moderated and allayed by the coldneſs of the adjoyning Seas, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try generally is found very agreeable to Engliſh bodies. The Soil abundantly fruitfull, not only of the natural Commodities of the Place, but likewiſe of all ſuch as are tranſported thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of <hi>England.</hi> Great ſtore of Woods and Trees both for Fruit and Building; plenty
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:170201:141"/>
of Deer; and of Turkies, Partridges, Swans, Geeſe, Cranes, Ducks, and Pigeons, ſo great aboundance, as ſerve the Inhabitants almoſt to exceſs. But the Commodities whereby they chiefly maintain their Trade, are rich Furres, many ſorts of good Fiſh, ſome quantity of Amber, Flax, Linnen, Iron, Pitch, Maſts, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, yea and timber for Shipping. In a word, it is ſuppoſed by thoſe which ſeem to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Country well, That there is little coms for <hi>England</hi> by the way of the Sound, but might be had from hence, at eaſier rates and leſs trouble, if the buſines were well conſidered. The Natives of the Countrie are ſaid to be much better diſpoſed, more tractable, docil, and apt to be perſwaded to civility, than their Neighbours; eſpecially when they are fairly dealt withall, and not provoked into diſtemper by rough handling. The Countrie on the Sea ſide repleniſhed with very good Havens. They report, that in the ſpace of 70 miles, there are no leſs than twenty or twenty five good and ſecure ports, ſome of them capable of five hundred or a thouſand ſail of ſhips, and fenced from the fury of windes and Sea, by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of certain Iſlets, which, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of two hundred at leaſt, are ſaid to lye ſcattered up and down upon that Coaſt.</p>

                        <pb n="264" facs="tcp:170201:142"/>The places where the Engliſh have chiefly ſeated themſelves, are, 1. <hi>St. Georges Fort;</hi> where the firſt Plantation was ſetled, at the mouth of the River <hi>Sagahadoc,</hi> in a kinde of <hi>Peninſula</hi> or half-Iſland. 2. <hi>New-Plimouth,</hi> ſeated no leſs commodiouſly upon a large and ſpacious Bay, called by the Natives <hi>Patouxet.</hi> It conſiſted at the firſt building but of nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Families only, but is now improved into a handſome Town. 3. <hi>New-Briſtoll,</hi> upon the Sea ſide alſo, but lying more Northerly than <hi>Plimouth.</hi> 4. <hi>Barſtable.</hi> 5. <hi>Boſton:</hi> And laſtly <hi>Quillipiack,</hi> which by the name ſeems to have been ſome old Town of the Natives, who upon a great mortality happening among them, are ſaid to have diſerted theſe parts of the Countrie but a few years before the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh came thither: It lyeth upon a Bay called the Bay of the <hi>Maſſachouſetts,</hi> and is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent poſſeſſed by the Engliſh.</p>
                     <p>This part of <hi>Virginia</hi> was firſt diſcovered by Captain <hi>Goſnold,</hi> in the year 1602. Four years after that King <hi>James</hi> granted it by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents unto a Corporation of certain Knights, Gentlemen, and Merchants to be planted by them and managed to the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Publique: In which Sir <hi>John Popham,</hi> Lord chief Juſtice of the Common-Pleas,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:170201:142"/>
being one of the principall, by his encouragement, and chiefly alſo at his charge a Colony was ſent thither in the year 1607, under the Preſidencie of Captain <hi>George Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Raleigh Gilbert:</hi> but the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Popham</hi> dying the next year after, and not long after him the Lord chief-Juſtice like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, who was the chief Patron of the work, the Colonie returned home: and though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards it was attempted ſeveral times, yet never could they finde ſucceſs in their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, nor be ſetled in any form, till the year 1620: When, by the building of <hi>New-Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> and ſome more particular care had of the buſineſs, by ſeveral incouragements ſent from thence to bring on others, and by reaſon of ſome domeſtick motives which perſwaded many people to leave their Countrie and goe that way, it is grown at laſt to a very probable and hopefull condition of good ſubſiſtence for the future, being, for many temporal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, worthy of all favour and cheriſhing by the State.</p>

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:170201:143"/>
Plantation there about the year 1614: The Countrie, as they ſaid, being then void, and therefore free for any body that would take poſſeſſion of it: Notwithſtanding which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, they were ſcarſe warm in their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, when Sir <hi>Sam.

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:170201:143"/>
Terms, for a good while, they held it. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, upon confidence, it ſeems, of a new Governour ſent from <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> they not only failed to pay the promiſed contribution and tribute, but fell to fortifie themſelves, and to entitle the Merchants of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> to an abſolute Propriety and Dominion of the Countrie, independent of any other; building Towns, as <hi>New Amſterdam,</hi> raiſing Forts, as <hi>Orange Fort,</hi> neer that branch of the <hi>Nordt River,</hi> which they call <hi>Hell gates.</hi> Complaint whereof being made to King <hi>Charles,</hi> and by his Embaſſador repreſented to the States, they diſown the buſineſs, and declare by publique inſtrument, that they were not intereſſed in it, but that it was only a private undertaking, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Weſt Indian Company of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam.</hi> Whereupon a Commiſſion was granted to Sir <hi>George Culvert,</hi> made Lord <hi>Baltimore</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to poſſeſs and plant the Southern parts thereof, lying towards <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia,</hi> by the name of <hi>Maryland;</hi> and to Sir <hi>Edmund Loyden</hi> to plant the Northern parts towards <hi>New-England,</hi> by the name of <hi>Nova-Albion:</hi> Which makes the Dutch the ſecond time ſeem willing to compound; and for the ſumme of two thouſand and five hundred pounds, they offer to be gone, and leave all

they had there. But by advantage of the troubles in <hi>England,</hi> which then began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and ſoon after followed, they not only goe back from their firſt Propoſitions, and make higher demands, but alſo moſt miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly and wickedly (as ſome report) they furniſh the Natives with Arms, and teach them the uſe of them, as it may be thought, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting to uſe their help, upon occaſion, againſt the Engliſh. An Act queſtionleſs of very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious conſequence, not only to the Engliſh Adventurers, who have ſince been much damni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and prejudiced by the ſaid Natives in their Plantations, but alſo to the Dutch themſelves; who, as 'tis reported, were the firſt, or with the firſt, that ſmarted by it: The Savages, being thus arm'd and train'd, firſt of all falling foule upon them, deſtroying their Farm-houſes, and forcing them to betake themſelves to their Forts and Faſtneſſes: So that at preſent there is but little good account can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven further of the State of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.</p>
                     <p>As to the nature and quality of the ſoil, it differeth not much from the parts about it; the temperature of the aire and commodities of the Country being generally the ſame, which <hi>New-England</hi> or <hi>Virginia</hi> yeeldeth. And as
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:170201:144"/>
for Towns and places of abode, it doth not appeare, that either the Engliſh or Dutch have as yet ſet themſelves much to building in this Country. What the Engliſh had done before our late troubles at home, it may be feared, is wholly ruined by the misfortunes which befell them there: And for the Dutch, although they make large reports of the Country, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge a huge Circuit of land under the name of the <hi>New-Netherlands,</hi> and title of the States; yet I ſuppoſe they have had their hands ſo full of other buſineſs of late, that they have not added much to what they had, when our troubles began; which was only <hi>New-Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi> as they call it, and <hi>Orange-Fort,</hi> afore mentioned; nor is it ſo certain, whither they be Maſter of them at this day or no. In ſtead of Rivers, which this Country ſeemeth a little to want, there are many large and capacious Bayes all along the Coaſt: the principall whereof are, that which the Dutch call <hi>Naſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius-Bay,</hi> ſometimes the <hi>Nordt-river,</hi> which falleth by it into the Sea at <hi>May-port.</hi> 2. <hi>Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> which is but a Channell of the great <hi>Nordt-river,</hi> ſo called by reaſon of its difficult and dangerous entrance; though within it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffords a very ſafe road for ſhipping, and fifteen or ſixteen fathom of water at the mouth.

3. <hi>Zuid-river,</hi> ſo called becauſe it lieth more Southerly than the reſt.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But <hi>Virginia</hi> properly ſo called, is in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condition. This is an elder Daughter of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, &amp; one of her firſt Plantations, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> having endured diverſitie of fortunes, and ſtrugling for a long time at the beginning with ill ſucceſſes, is at laſt by the favour of Divine Providence arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unto ſuch a competent happineſs, as that the Colonie are ſaid to live very comfortably and helpfully among themſelves, and to give good hopes of perpetuating, and improving their condition to poſterity. The Country hath on the North-eaſt of it <hi>Niew-Nederlandt</hi> aforeſaid, on the South-weſt <hi>Florida;</hi> the name of <hi>Virginia,</hi> which before was common to the whole Province, being, upon the Plantation of <hi>New-England</hi> and that other, reſtrained to this part of the Country only, which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth from the thirty fourth to the thirty eighth degree of Northern latitude. The Country ſomewhat inclined to heats; which yet are much moderated by thoſe Conſtant Eaſterly windes, which they call <hi>Briſes,</hi> and by ſome other cooling blaſts from the Ocean ever and anon. It is a Country generally well diſtinguiſhed into Hills and Valleys: the firſt whereof are well cloathed with Woods, and
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:170201:145"/>
the latter with Fruits. The ſoile being ſo good, that 'tis ſaid in many places, an acre of land well husbanded will return two hundred bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhels, or twenty five quarter of good grain: rich in veins of Allom, as likewiſe in Pitch, Turpentine, Oile, plenty of ſweet Gummes, and ſeverall ſorts of plants for Dyers uſe: not wanting many good Mines of Iron, Copper, &amp;c. Timber and tall Cedar-trees in infinite abundance; much Cattle: Fiſh and Fowl of all ſorts: no ſcarſity of <hi>Maiz</hi> among the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; on the mountains ſome Chriſtall is found, and on the Shore Pearls. To be ſhort, excepting thoſe metalls of <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Mexico,</hi> (of which I hear not, that any diſcoveries as yet have been made in theſe parts) it ſeems not deficient in any thing, that may encourage or reward an induſtrious people. The Country not half peopled with Natives; and thoſe that are there found, as much differing one from another in ſize, as in language and manners. There are ſome, whom they call <hi>Saſques-Hanoxi</hi> of ſuch a vaſt bulk and ſtature, that they ſeemed, as it were Gyants to the Engliſh themſelves; others, whom they call <hi>Wigcoco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moci,</hi> ſo little and low, that in companie with the other they ſeem'd but ſo many <hi>Pigmies:</hi> but the generality of them, it muſt be confeſſed,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:170201:146"/>
are taller and well limb'd, though moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly without beards. Their cloathing is mantles of Deer-skins with ſomething like an apron hanging before them. They paint their bodies and faces all over with figures of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents and other horrid creatures, 'as tis thought, only that they may ſeem terrible to their enimies, who are ſo wiſe as to fright them again as much with the ſame. Theſe of <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> are held to be crafty and revengefull, and not a little more induſtrious and active, than other Natives, eſpecially towards the <hi>North.</hi> There is no Country in the world, for the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, better watered than this part of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia</hi> is, with many pleaſant and fair Rivers: the cheife whereof are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Pawhatan,</hi> ſo named from a principall Roytelet of theſe parts, whoſe Territores are divided and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully fertilized by this River, which runs a courſe of an hundred miles, navigable all the way, at leaſt by ſmaller Veſſels, and falls into the Sea with a mouth two or three miles broad. 2. <hi>Nanſamund.</hi> 3. <hi>Pammanuke.</hi> 4. <hi>Toppaphanock,</hi> navigable one hundred and thirty miles. 5. <hi>Pawtunxet,</hi> of a deeper Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell than any of the reſt, and affording variety of choice fiſh, with divers others.</p>
                     <p>The Engliſh firſt ſetled their Plantation
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:170201:146"/>
upon the South-ſide of a large and goodly Bay, called by the Natives <hi>Cheſe-peack,</hi> which thruſting it ſelf a good way up into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and receiving into its boſome many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Rivers, yeelds a very ſafe ſtation for ſhips, and is the only entrance into this part of the Countrie: The Capes or Points where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are therefore well fortified, particularly Cape <hi>Henry,</hi> Cape <hi>Charls, &amp;c.</hi> The Towns which the Engliſh have built, or doe frequent in way of Trade, are chiefly 1. <hi>James-Town,</hi> ſo named by the firſt Adventurers, in honour of King <hi>James:</hi> it lyeth on the South ſide of the Bay, and was firſt built in the year 1606, but ſince fortified with a Trench drawn round about it, and ſome pieces of Ordinance plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 2. <hi>Henricopolis,</hi> or <hi>Henries Town,</hi> ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from Prince <hi>Henrie,</hi> then living, built in a very convenient place more within Land, about fourſcore miles diſtant from <hi>James-Town.</hi> 3. <hi>Dales-guift,</hi> ſo named, becauſe built and planted at the charges of Sir <hi>Thomas Dale,</hi> Deputy Governour of the Countrie, about the year 1610. There is alſo <hi>Ketough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> a Town of the Natives upon the Bay, where the Engliſh are ſaid to frequent and trade much. And laſtly <hi>Wicocomoco,</hi> a Town of <hi>Powhatans,</hi> one of the chief Roytelets of
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:170201:147"/>
the Country, as hath been ſaid, whom the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, at their firſt comming thither, courted much, and procured a Crown of Copper, with ſome other richer preſents, to be ſent him from King <hi>James,</hi> on purpoſe to oblige him: which yet they were hardly able to doe. For although he profeſſed likewiſe on his part very much love and affection to the Engliſh, yet partly by his procurement, as 'tis ſaid, and partly through their own overmuch ſecurity, not with out ſome provocations given on the part of the Engliſh, there were, about the year 1621 no leſs than three hundred and fourty Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men murdred by the Savages, unexpectedly fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in upon them, and with ſuch violence and reſolution, as that if a certain Native of the Countrie, become Chriſtian, had not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the buſineſs a very little before to them at <hi>James-Town,</hi> their principall Fort and place of ſtrength had been ſurprized, and the whole Colony almoſt at the mercy of the Savages. But it pleaſed God to prevent their utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction by that means: And ſince that time, I ſuppoſe they ſtand better upon their guard.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The <hi>Bermudas</hi> are a multitude of ſmall Iſlands in the Atlantick or North-Sea, as at the Indies they call it, lying right over againſt
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:170201:147"/>
                        <hi>Virginia,</hi> at a diſtance of four or five hundred miles. They lye from thirty to thirty two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Northern latitude, in form of a Croiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, or half-Moon; being ſo called from <hi>John Bermudaz</hi> a Spaniard, who firſt diſcovered them. But the principall of them, and that which is moſt properly called <hi>Bermudaz</hi> Iſland, lyeth at the loweſt and moſt Southerly corner of them, in the latitude of thirty two degrees, and twenty five minutes. They are ſometimes called <hi>the Summer Iſlands,</hi> from Sir <hi>George Summers;</hi> who, in the year 1609. in company of Sir <hi>Thomas Gates,</hi> and about one hundred and fifty perſons more, ſailing towards <hi>Virginia,</hi> hardly eſcaped a terrible ſhipwrack upon theſe Iſlands: the ſhip, which they were forced to run on ſhore, being loſt, but the men and much of her lading, by Gods great mercy, ſaved by their Boats. They found the place altogether deſolate, inhabited neither by Man nor Beaſt, ſave only ſome Swine in the Woods; but of Fowle ſuch infinite plenty, that they would take a thouſand of ſome one ſort as big as Pidgeons, in 2 or 3 houres; with theſe and the Swine they found there, which were very large and fat, for the moſt part of the time they ſtayed, and with variety of fiſh they ſuſtained themſelves happily, till they had
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:170201:148"/>
built a new Ship and a Bark, ſufficient to waſt them and their Company over to <hi>Virginia.</hi> They found likewiſe diverſe ſorts of fruits in the Iſlands, very pleaſing and good: aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Mulberry trees and Silk-worms. <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitos,</hi> Cedar-trees, and others; on the Sea coaſts ſome quantity of Pearls, Amber-greeſe, and other good Commodities, an Aire gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſo temperate and agreeable to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, that they reioyced not a little in their misfortune, which had caſt them upon a place ſo likely to be advantagious to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and the Nation: as by their earneſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement it hath ſince in part proved: it being at this day one of the chiefeſt Plantations of the Engliſh: and though as yet they ſeem to trade only in Tobacco, as likewiſe <hi>Virginia</hi> is ſaid to doe; yet it is not through any defect either in the one Countrie or the other, as if they afforded no better Commodities, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through the fault and unskilfulneſs of the Planters, who buſie themſelves only in thoſe ordinary and eaſie Commodies, and neglect the improvement of better, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Silk-worms and of making Silk. The firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonie was ſent thither in the year 1612, under the command of Captain <hi>Rich. Moore;</hi> which proſpered ſo well, that in a few years the whole
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:170201:148"/>
Iſland, (<hi>viz.</hi> the principall one) where they doe chiefly inhabit, was divided into <hi>Cantreds,</hi> or Hundreds, as we may call them, and to every Hundred a Burrough or chief Town aſſigned, and the Government ſetled entirely according to the Laws of <hi>England.</hi> In the year 1623 there were no leſs than three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand reckoned to be there, ten good Forts erected, and about fiftie pieces of Ordinance planted upon them: although the place it ſelf is ſo naturally fenced with Rocks and little Iſlands lying about it, that the Inhabitants, in that reſpect only, ſeem to contemn all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from without: it being almoſt impoſſible, without particular knowledge of the paſſages, for a Veſſel of but eight or ten Tuns to come ſafely into Harbour: and yet with ſuch know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge there is both eaſie paſſage and ſecure ſtation for the talleſt ſhips.</p>

rather by the great pains which the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards have taken, and the ill ſucceſſes which they have met with in the diſcovery and ſearch of this Province, than by any thing elſe they have diſcovered in it anſwerable to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. On the Eaſt it hath the Atlantick Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, or <hi>Mare del Nordt.</hi> On the South and ſome part of the Weſt, the Gulf of <hi>Mexico;</hi> and on the reſt of the Weſt, part of <hi>New-Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia,</hi> and ſome other Countries, not yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly known. It was firſt of all diſcovered by Sir <hi>Sebaſtian Cabot</hi> (as hath been ſaid) at the charges of the King of <hi>England,</hi> about the yeare 1497; but afterwards more throughly ſearched into by <hi>John de Ponce,</hi> a Spaniard, in the year 1512, and by him named <hi>Florida,</hi> becauſe he firſt landed upon it on Palm-Sunday, which, as they ſay, the Spaniards uſe to call <hi>Paſcha de Flores,</hi> or <hi>Paſcha Florida.</hi> The Countrie lyeth in the ſame parallel with <hi>Caſtile</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and is ſuppoſed to be of a neer temperature with it, both for Aire and Soil: only this of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> is ſuppoſed to be ſomewhat the more fertil and luſty, as not having as yet been worn out with Tillage and uſe, as the other hath. They have great plenty of <hi>Maiz</hi> in this Countrie, which they both ſow and reap in leſs than four Moneths ſpace; and which is
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:170201:149"/>
ſomewhat more obſervable, among People otherwiſe barbarous, it is not counted among them any mans private poſſeſſion; but laid up in publique Granaries and Barns out of which it is orderly diſtributed at all times to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons and Families, according to their neceſſity. Its well ſtored likewiſe with diverſe ſorts of Fruits, both proper to the Country, and common to other parts; eſpecially with a kinde of Plum of a rare colour and taſte, Mulberry trees, Cherry trees, Cheſnuts, Grapes, &amp;c. Beaſts they have in aboundance, both wilde and tame, with no leſs plenty of Fowl. Many huge Foreſts and leſſer Woods, well repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with good Okes of the largeſt ſize, lofty Cedars, Cypreſs, and Bay trees, with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary plenty of that wood which the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans call <hi>Pavame,</hi> and the French <hi>Saffaſras,</hi> the bark whereof is ſaid to be very Medicinal in ſundry Diſeiſes, eſpecially for the Stone, and all obſtructions of Urine, Winde-Colick, and others; and therefore much uſed by the Apothecaries. They have alſo another ſort of wood called <hi>Eſquine,</hi> not unknown in other parts, affirmed to be of ſoveraign and preſent remedie againſt the <hi>Lues Venerea;</hi> a Maladie which the Indians are ſaid to be generally, and not ſeldome very fouly ſubject unto: yea they
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:170201:150"/>
ſay, that the Spaniards from the Indies firſt brought it into <hi>Italy</hi> and other parts of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope;</hi> where formerly it was either not at all or at leaſt not much known. 'Tis likewiſe thought, that the Country is not altogether without Mines of Gold and Silver, eſpecially about the mountains <hi>Apalatei,</hi> as they call them, though neglected by the Natives, till the Spaniards came and rifled ſo ſtrangely for Gold in the other Provinces; which probably might make the Natives of this Province to conceale theirs, when the Spaniards were among them; and ſtill to forbear the ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after it (in caſe that indeed they have any) only that they may not be troubled with ſuch Ghueſts. But for Emralds, Turquoiſes, and other fine Stones, it is certain, the Countrie hath many, of great worth and beauty: but the plenty of theſe make them cheap at the Indies, and to be thought not worth the ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after. The People of this Countrie are ſomewhat of the largeſt ſize and ſtature, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of other Americans generally, yet well proportion'd withall, going for the moſt part naked, only with ſome skin of a Stag, or other Beaſt, tyed before them. Their hair black and let to grow; ſo that in many of them it hangs down as low as their thighs. Cunning they
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:170201:150"/>
are ſaid to be, and great diſſemblers; ſtomack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and much given to revenge: which is the cauſe that they are ſeldome, but in warre, one with another. One thing, they ſay, there is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to this Country of <hi>Florida, viz.</hi> that it breeds aboundance of Hermaphrodites, more than any other part of the world beſide: whom they likewiſe uſe moſt hardly, making them carry their burthens and luggage like Beaſts, and putting them to all kinde of Drudgery.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Country is generally plain and level, having few or no mountains at all in it, ſave only the <hi>Apalatei,</hi> ſuppoſed by the Natives to have rich Mines of gold in them, and which the Spaniards ſaw, but had not time nor other neceſſarie accommodation to ſtay and ſearch them; by reaſon they were ſo much wearied and waſted with a long March, before they gat thither, and found the People ſo ſtout and obſtinate thereabouts, that in ſtead of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them with their Hens and Fowl as other places had done, they were welcom'd with blows, and made to return, leaving not a few of their beſt Soldiers behinde. Rivers there are many, and thoſe very large and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, as namely <hi>Rio Secco,</hi> or the <hi>dry Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> ſo called by the Spaniards (as ſome think)
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:170201:151"/>
becauſe they could finde no gold in it. 2. <hi>Rio Grande,</hi> or the great River. 3. <hi>Ligeris.</hi> 4. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runna.</hi> 5. <hi>Sequana, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe laſt, ſo named by the French, who, after the Spaniards, for ſome time had, but never held any long poſſeſſion of the Countrie. There are alſo <hi>Rio de Flores, Rio de Nieves, Rio de Spirito Santo,</hi> leſſer ſtreams, yet all of them with the reſt, falling at ſeveral places into the great Lake of <hi>Mexico;</hi> and ſome of them, not a little haunted by the <hi>Caymans</hi> or Weſt-Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Crocodiles, a Creature, as hath been ſaid before, dangerous both at Sea and Land. The Country hath not yet been ſo well diſcovered, much leſs conquered or ſubdued by thoſe who pretend themſelves to be Maſters of it, as to be diſtinguiſhed into any certain Provinces. The Natives, who as yet hold poſſeſſion and command of it for the moſt part, are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves generally ſorted into certain Tribes or great Families; all which are governed ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally by a chief of their own, whom they call <hi>Paracouſſi;</hi> and by reaſon thereof, are almoſt continally in feud and warre one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Provinces or parts of the Country, that I finde any way mentioned by Authors, with any account at all of their ſituation and bounds, are only theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Panuco.</hi> 2. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las:</hi>

For though he took it from them, it was not without ſome reſiſtance, and they quickly recovered it again: and at 2. <hi>Aute,</hi> another old Town of theirs, nine dayes march from the other, they overtook him, and fell ſo reſolutely upon him, that he left not a few of his beſt Souldiers dead upon the place, and was content himſelf to march quietly away with the reſt. 3. <hi>Ochalis,</hi> a Town conſiſting of about 5 or 600 Sheds and Cottages likewiſe of the Natives. 4. <hi>Vittacuche</hi> a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough of two hundred Houſes.

                        <pb n="286" facs="tcp:170201:153"/>
to <hi>Apalche,</hi> as was ſaid, (which was a full moneths march from the place of his firſt land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) out of hopes of ſome great Treaſures there to be found, though at firſt he made ſhift to maſter ſome of their petty Towns, yet final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he loſt both himſelf and moſt of his men. Laſtly the expedition of <hi>Hernandes a Soto</hi> in the yeare 1543. though more famous than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe, yet proved as fruitleſs as the reſt. He began his March in the yeare 1538. and continued it till 1543. over-running the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with a little Armie of three hundred and fifty horſe and 90 foote, ſubduing the <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couſſi,</hi> or petty Princes, where he came, to the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> and compelling them to ſend in their Turkies, Hens and other Fowles, for the victualling of his running Camp, every day: till at laſt finding his hopes of gold fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and a good part of his Army waſted, and the reſt much weakned with travell, ſtruck with greife, and (as ſome ſay alſo) with a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he died in the midſt of his journey, and the remnant of his company, under the command of <hi>Ludevico Muſcoſo</hi> his Lieutenant, with much difficulty recovered <hi>Mexico</hi> at laſt. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo many unſucceſsfull attempts, the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards ſeem to leave the Country; whereupon the French enter, ſent thither by <hi>Gaſpar Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligni</hi>
                        <pb n="287" facs="tcp:170201:153"/>
Admirall of <hi>France</hi> in the yeare 1562, but they were ſuch as the Spaniards liked not to have ſo neer them: wherefore immediatly upon the landing of a ſecond ſupply in the year 1565 at <hi>Charls Fort</hi> upon the River <hi>Port-royall</hi> above ſaid, the Spaniards ſet upon them both by Sea and Land, force their Ships violently upon the rocks, ſack the new Town, and put the whole Colony to the ſword (ſcarce one man eſcaping) together with <hi>Ribault</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who was Commander in chief for the expedition. There were above ſix hundred French ſlain in this Action, and all their hopes in <hi>Florida</hi> thereby utterly extinct. Since that time the Spaniards have better fortified thoſe places of the <hi>Peninſula, viz. Saint. Matthews</hi> and <hi>Saint Auguſtines</hi> aboveſaid; together with the Caſtles of <hi>Saint Philip</hi> and <hi>Saint Jage</hi> in the more northerly parts of it. But it is like <hi>Aeſops</hi> dog in the manger, rather to keep out others, than that they make any good improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Country themſelves: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they were beaten out, and ſent to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their Mines and Sugar-mills elſwhere, it may ſeem but juſt. The Country is a large and goodly Province of <hi>America,</hi> of a fertil and good ſoil generally, yet neither peopled with Natives, nor uſed in any ſort as it ought, to
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:170201:154"/>
the honor of God and the advancement of publick good. What reaſon or juſtice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can it be, that the Spaniards, only by the advantage of a Fort or two upon the Coaſts, ſhould pretend to be Lords of the whole land? and neither improve it themſelves, as it ought to be improved, nor permit any other Nations, that are willing ſo to doe? 'Tis ſuppoſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, they keep it as a reſerve of Treaſure to themſelves, that when they have leaſure, or that their Mines at <hi>Potozi,</hi> or other places fail, they may make a further ſearch about the <hi>Apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latti</hi> of this Province; of which there are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident reports that they have Mines; and though ſucceſs hitherto hath not anſwered their endeavours much, yet they deſpaire not in due time to finde them, upon an abſolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the Country and a more thorough ſearch. And truly their policie and great provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſeems not eaſily to be condemned: but in the mean time, if any other Nation upon juſt grounds ſhall happen to ſtep between and prevent them, they have but little reaſon to complain, or to count themſelves inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. There lie over againſt the Country of <hi>Florida</hi> weſtward, or ſouthweſt certain ſmall Iſlands, which becauſe they are but ſmall ones,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:170201:154"/>
and lye ſo neer the Continent, Geographers ſometimes deſcribe as a part and appertaining to the Continent. They are called by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall name the <hi>Leucayae</hi> Iſlands, and have not much to be ſpoken of them. The cheife are firſt <hi>Las Tortugas,</hi> or the <hi>Tortoiſes,</hi> which are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eight little Iſlands lying together at the South-weſt point of the <hi>Peninſula</hi> called <hi>Cape Florida,</hi> right over againſt the Port <hi>Havana</hi> of the Iſle <hi>Cuba;</hi> from which they are diſtant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five or ſix leagues; and by their lying ſo ſcattered up and down in the Sea, as they doe, they make the paſſage from thence to <hi>Havana</hi> not a little dangerous. Secondly <hi>Los Martire.</hi> Theſe are three great rocks, rather than Iſlands lying to the South-eaſt of <hi>Cape Florida,</hi> and covered for the moſt part with a whitiſh ſand and a few buſhes growing on them. They ſeem at a diſtance to beare a reſemblance of men im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pald, or bound to ſtakes, as the Martyrs in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times uſually were; which occaſioned the Spaniards ſo to name them. 'Tis very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to come too neer them; but to have ſight of them is of great uſe to men at Sea: For by paſſing theſe rocks, and leaving them to the South-eaſt, they certainly know, that they are now <hi>entred the Streits,</hi> not of <hi>Magel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> which lye many thouſands of leagues fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:170201:155"/>
Southward, (of which we ſhall ſpeake in due place) but of <hi>Bahama;</hi> that is, that they have left the Ocean, and are fallen in among thoſe many Iſlands, which doe, as it were <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricado</hi> and block up the Eaſtern Coaſts of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica</hi> towards <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> and <hi>Terra firma,</hi> as they call it; through which the paſſage to the Continent is ſometimes dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, by reaſon of contrary windes; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſuch, as it requires the skill and care of an experienced <hi>Pilot</hi> to conduct the Ships well thither. Thirdly, <hi>Bahama,</hi> lying weſtward of <hi>Cape Florida,</hi> famous for nothing but only for giving name to the <hi>Streits</hi> ſo called, which run betwixt the <hi>Peninſula</hi> of <hi>Florida</hi> and it, with ſuch a violent courſe and torrent, that although it be above ſixteen miles broad, yet many times neither winde nor Oares can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt it.

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:170201:156"/>
joyning to the Continent of <hi>Tartary.</hi> It is likewiſe the barreneſt and leaſt fruitfull part of all the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> eſpecially for Corn. Cattle it hath great ſtore, and paſturage good; the Countrie being for the moſt part plain and level, and nothing elſe but paſturage: The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives few and Savage; living in Hoards, or great Companies together, after the manner of the Tartars: to whom they are Neighbours; and, as it is not improbably thought, of their race: They cloath themſelves (<hi>viz.</hi> the Men) moſt commonly in that kinde of Oxes hide which we deſcribed before, <hi>chap.</hi> 9. under the name of <hi>Taurus Mexicanus:</hi> The Women with little elſe but their hair; notwithſtanding the Countrie, eſpecially for one halfe of the year, is evceſſively cold.

Yet ſome of them inhabit Towns; the chief whereof, as yet diſcovered, ſeem to be theſe, <hi>viz. Acus,</hi> or <hi>Acuco,</hi> as ſome call it, a ſmall Town, but ſeated in a ſtrong defenſible place, having ſome ſmall quantity of Cotton growing about it. 2. <hi>Tignez,</hi> a Town ſeated
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:170201:156"/>
upon the banks of a River, bearing the ſame name, and inhabited, it ſeems, by a ſtout and reſolute People, and whom the Spaniſh, coming among them in the year 1540, had much adoe to Maſter. They endured a ſiege for the ſpace of ſix weeks together; and at laſt finding themſelves ſo ſtrongly begirt by enemies, that there was no means of eſcape, but by death or yeelding up themſelves, rather than they would fall alive into their hands, they firſt buried and ſpoiled all ſuch Treaſure as they had (which were chiefly Saphirs, and a few other Gemms that the Countrie afforded) and after that ſetting fire on their houſhold ſtuff, they took their Wives and Children with them, and made a deſperate ſalley out upon the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards; wherein, although they were moſt of them ſlain, trod under the horſe feet, or drown'd in paſſing the River, yet was it not without ſome loſs to the Spaniards themſelves: Nor would thoſe few that were left behinde deliver up the Town, till it was fired about their ears, and that they could no longer abide in it. 3. <hi>Cicuic,</hi> another ſmall Town four dayes journey diſtant from <hi>Tignez.</hi> The Countrie about this place, although generally it be all good paſturage, and maintains aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Cattel, yet is it ſo open and plain,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:170201:157"/>
that for almoſt one hundred miles together the Spaniards in their march hither from <hi>New-Spain</hi> found neither ſtone nor tree, nor any thing elſe that could ſerve them for a Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark: ſo that they were forced, as they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched along, to raiſe up heaps of the Country Cow-dung, to ſerve them for direction in their coming back: which was not long after. For, not finding the Commodities they ſought for, and fearing to be ſurprized by Winter in thoſe cold Countries, where they had no kinde of accommodation, they made ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a haſty retreat: leaving only behinde them ſome few Religious men, of the Order of <hi>St. Francis,</hi> whoſe deſires to doe the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple good by converting them to the true knowledge and worſhip of Almighty God, procured them not long after, the Crown of Martyrdom; being murdred all of them ſave one, by the Natives, and he not without much difficulty eſcaping their hands.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Cibola</hi> lyeth more Southward of <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vira,</hi> betwixt it and <hi>New-Gallicia</hi> to the North and North-Eaſt: On the Weſt it hath <hi>Mar Vermiglio,</hi> or the Bay of <hi>Califormia.</hi> The Aire of the Province indifferently tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, eſpecially if compared to the ſharp froſts and colds of <hi>Quivira.</hi> The Countrie, for the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:170201:157"/>
moſt part level and plain, as <hi>Quivira</hi> is. Few trees at all in it, except here and there ſome woods of Cedars: which yet doe aboundantly ſupply the Natives both with Timber and Fuel. The ground affords plenty of <hi>Maiz,</hi> and ſome ſmall white Peaſe; of both which they uſually make bread. There is great ſtore of Veniſon, and a kinde of Sheep (as they ſay, and as it ſhould ſeem by their Fleece) as big as ſome little Horſe or Oxen; ſome of their horns weighing fourty or fifty pound. But perhaps, by ſome miſtake of Authors, this Beaſt may be no other then the <hi>Taurus Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus</hi> afore deſcribed: whoſe hair is extreamly thick and ſhaggie, and of which they make cloath, as of wooll, as hath been ſaid. There are alſo Lyons, Bears, and Tygres in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, in ſuch numbers, than the People of the Countrie are not a little troubled with them, and would gladly deſtroy them, if they knew how. The People are generally well limb'd, tall of ſtature, and ſeem to be a little more ingenious than their neighbours of <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vira:</hi> yet they goe naked many of them, only covered before with Mantles made of skins: which are many times painted, and that with ſuch curioſity and Art, as doe ſufficiently ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, that neither themſelves nor their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:170201:158"/>
of <hi>Quivira,</hi> from whom they have them in traffique, doe make them; but that they are the Merchandiſe and Commodities of ſome other Nations, perhaps of <hi>Cathay</hi> or <hi>China,</hi> who, by the North-weſt Seas, doe trade with the Maritime parts and People of <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vira.</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. This part of the Countrie hath been reaſonably well ſearched by the Spaniards, but as yet nothing diſcovered ſo conſiderable as to perſwade them to ſtay in it. That which ſeems moſt obſervable, is the great Lake <hi>Tonteac,</hi> ſituate almoſt in the midſt of the Province; upon which, or neer unto it, they found ſeven or eight old Towns of the Natives, ſome whereof contained four or five hundred of their Cottages or little houſes, and were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified alſo with Ramparts, and other works of defence; ſo as the Spaniards could not become Maſters of them but by force and ſtorming them: in the attempt whereof <hi>Vaſquez Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado</hi> himſelf, their Commander in chief, was twice beaten down with ſtones, by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; yet at laſt carrying the place, he found in it good plenty of <hi>Maiz</hi> indeed, which was ſome refreſhment to his Army, but nothing elſe: whereupon having named the place <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada,</hi> in memory of the Vice-Roy of <hi>New-Spain,</hi>
                        <pb n="297" facs="tcp:170201:158"/>
who ſent him upon that expedition, he departed. In his return homeward he fell upon a certain Countrie, which he named <hi>Tucayan,</hi> of which his companie report great matters: as firſt of a certain River called <hi>Huex,</hi> on the banks whereof, in the ſpace of twenty leagues or thereabouts, there ſtand no leſs than fifteen good Burroughs well built, and furniſhed likewiſe with ſtoves or hot-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, againſt the cold, as in other Countries of <hi>Europe:</hi> as alſo of a very fruitfull and pleaſant Valley, which therefore they called <hi>Aroya de Corazones,</hi> of another gteat Town and Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie thereto belonging, called <hi>Chichilticala:</hi> and laſtly of the Valley of <hi>Nueſtra Sennora,</hi> or our Ladies dale, in the South parts of the ſaid Territorie; all of them deſcribed for ſuch rich and delicious places, that ſome take them for the <hi>Campi Eliſii</hi> of <hi>America:</hi> eſpecially ſeeing the Spaniards were never known to viſit them the ſecond time; the diſcoveries which have been made ſince, being only of the North-weſt parts of the Countrie along the coaſts of <hi>Mar Vermiglio;</hi> and this no further than only to give name to certain Capes or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montories which they met with, as namely 1. <hi>Porto de St. Clara,</hi> neer to the mouth of the River which they call <hi>Rio del Nordt.</hi> 2. <hi>Las

                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Califormia,</hi> ſpecially ſo called, is by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thought and deſcribed to be but a <hi>Peninſula</hi> or half Iſland, by reaſon that the Bay which divides it from <hi>Quivira</hi> and <hi>New-Gallicia,</hi> towards the North runneth much narrower than it doth Southerly: which made them think, that ſomwhere or other at the North it was joyned to the main-Land of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica.</hi> But later diſcoveries have found it to be a perfect Iſland, and altogether ſeparate from the Continent. For about the yeer 1620 ſome Adventurers beating upon thoſe coaſts Northward, accidentally, and before they were aware, fell upon a Streit, the waters whereof ran with ſuch a Torrent and violent courſe, that they brought them into <hi>Mar Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miglio,</hi> whether they would or no, and before they knew it: and by that means diſcovered that <hi>Califormia</hi> was an Iſland, and that the waters which were obſerved to fall ſo violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into that Sea, towards the North, were not the waters of any River emptying it ſelf into the Bay from the main-Land, as was formerly thought, but the waters of the North-weſt Sea it ſelf, violently breaking into the Bay, and
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:170201:159"/>
dividing it wholly from the Continent. It lyeth North and South, extending it ſelf in a vaſt length, full twenty degrees of latitude, <hi>viz.</hi> from twenty two to fourty two; but the bredth nothing anſwerable. The moſt Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern point of it is called <hi>Cape Blanche:</hi> that to the South, <hi>Cape St. Lucas,</hi> memorable for that rich and gallant prize which Captain <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendiſh,</hi> in the year 1587, being then in his voyage about the World, took from the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards neer to this place. As for the Iſland it ſelf, it is not at all inhabited by the Spaniards; whether it be, that they want men to furniſh new Plantations, or that they finde no matter of invitation and encouragement from the Countrie; or perhaps that the acceſs thither be not ſo eaſie. For 'tis reported to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully well peopled by the Natives; and that there were found only upon the coaſts and along the ſhore of <hi>Mar Vermiglio</hi> twenty or twenty three Nations, all of different langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. The Countrie aboundantly well ſtored both with Fiſh and Fowl, as appears partly by the Natives; who take an huge pride in making themſelves gay with the bones of the one, with which they load their eares, and ſometimes their noſes alſo: and with the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the other, which ordinary People
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:170201:160"/>
weare only ſticking about their waſte; but great perſons, and ſuch as will be fine indeed, beſet their heads ſtrangely with them, and have co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly one bunch of them bigger than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary hanging down behinde them like a tayle: Having no knowledge of the true God, they worſhip what the Devill will have them, that is, the Sun; attributing to it only, the increaſe of their Fruits and Plants, healthfull Seaſons, and moſt of the other good they enjoy, or are ſenſible of. Their government is ſaid to be only Oeconomicall, each Father ordering the affairs of his Familie apart, without ſubjection to any other ſuperiour; yet ſo well managed, that they live in good peace one with another; not without many good Laws and Cuſtomes, <hi>viz.</hi> That they allow but one wife to one Man, That they puniſh Adultery with death, That they ſuffer not Maids to talk or converſe with Men, till they be married, That Widdows may not marry, till they have mourned at leaſt one half of a year for their Husbands deceaſed, and divers others of like nature: which perhaps if the truth were known, doe more properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Natives of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia</hi> or <hi>New-Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> then to theſe of <hi>Califormia.</hi>

On the other ſide of the Iſland, towards the main Sea, there is firſt <hi>St. Abad,</hi> a good Haven, and almoſt ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a pleaſant and fruitfull Countrie. 2. <hi>Cape Trinidado.</hi> 3. <hi>Cape de Cedras.</hi> 4. <hi>Puebla de las Canoas,</hi> from the aboundance of thoſe little Boats which the Americans ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally uſe, and doe call <hi>Canoes;</hi> whereof perhaps ſome ſtore is made there. 5. <hi>Cabo de Galera,</hi> and ſome others.</p>

of the World, in the year 1577, and by him named <hi>Nova-Albion,</hi> in honour of <hi>England,</hi> his own Countrie, which anciently bore that name. They found the Countrie exceedingly well ſtored with Dear, grazing up and down the Hills by thouſands in a company: The Men generally goe naked all over, the Women uſing only a piece of a mat, or ſome ſuch thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of an Apron. Their houſes built only of Turf and Oſier; yet ſo wrought together, that they ſerved very well to keep out the cold: in the midſt of it is their hearth where they make their fire, and lye al round about it together, upon ſeveral Beds of Bulruſhes. What their Towns are, or whither they have any, is not yet diſcovered.

He was a perſon of goodly ſtature, cloathed all over with certain Conie skins of that Countrie, the furre where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is exceeding ſmooth and fine, and the only Robe of Nobility there. He had many other

tall men attending on him, and one that went before him, bearing ſomewhat inſtead of a Mace; at which there hung three Crowns, by ſo many chains; the Crowns were made of Feathers, the Chains of Bone; both of them very ingeniouſly wrought. After theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a great multitude of the common ſort of People, but none of them without his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of ſomething or other, even to the very Boys. The King would needs have the Crowns put upon the Generals head, and the Chains about his neck; to which he conſented: and by that Ceremonie promiſed, in the name and behalf of the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> from whom he ſaid he came, to take them into his protection. So after many other civilities gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and returned betwixt them, the King at length departed, and Sir <hi>Francis</hi> with his men returned to their ſhips; having firſt erected a pillar upon the place; on which he faſtned the Arms of <hi>England,</hi> with the Queens name and his own, to remain as a monument of his being there, and of the ſurrender which was made of that Country to the Queen of <hi>England.</hi>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of <hi>New-Gallicia,</hi> and the Provinces thereto belonging.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>NEw-Gallicia</hi> is the moſt Norther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Countrie of all <hi>America,</hi> that is inhabited to any purpoſe by the Spaniards. Here 'tis true, they are ſcattered up and down in all the parts of it; but it is at a huge diſtance, and for the moſt part only where the Mines are. It is bounded on the Eaſt and to the South with the Kingdom of <hi>Mexico,</hi> or <hi>New-Spain:</hi> on the Weſt with the Gulf or Bay of <hi>Califormia.</hi> Northward, for ſo much as is yet diſcovered, with <hi>Quivira</hi> and <hi>Cibola;</hi> lying between eighteen and twenty eight degrees of Northern latitude, that is, from <hi>La Natividad,</hi> a Port ſo named by the Spaniards, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of <hi>New-Spain,</hi> to the moſt Northerly borders of <hi>Cinoloa,</hi> a part of this Province; containing, as is ſuppoſed, not much leſs than three hundred leagues in length, and in bredth much more; and whereof not a tenth part is either uſed or frequented by the Spaniards: The Aire is generally here very temperate, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining rather to heat than cold, and ſubject
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:170201:162"/>
now and then to ſodain ſtorms of rain and great claps of thunder; which yet doe not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but that the Countrie is held to be reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably healthfull, and the people obſerved to live generally to a good old age. The Soil, by reaſon of the Climate, would be a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to drought, but that beſide the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent rains which it hath, it is conſtantly moiſtned with freſh morning dews; which make it for the moſt part wonderfully fruitfull, almoſt beyond beleef: yeelding for every bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhel of Wheat that is ſown threeſcore; and of <hi>Maiz</hi> two hundred for one: beſide great plenty of Sugar-Canes and Cochineel; both which, notwithſtanding the Spaniards are ſaid to neglect in ſome ſort, imploying themſelves wholly about richer Commodities. For the Countrie affords them good ſtore of Mines, <hi>viz.</hi> of Sylver and Braſs; but of Gold or Iron, not many as yet have been found: the Rivers plentifully abounding with Fiſh, and the Woods with Veniſon and ſome other wilde Beaſts. The Countrie generally more moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous than plain, frequently ſhaded with Woods and whole Forreſts of the ſtatelyeſt Pine trees and Oaks of timber that are to be ſeen. The People are ſaid to be ſomewhat of a wavering and inconſtant diſpoſition, apt to
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:170201:163"/>
take offence; and though civilized in ſome meaſure, and made Chriſtians by the Spaniards, yet oftentimes upon ſome light diſtaſte given, they ſeem willing to return again to their Woods and Barbariſm. The reaſon whereof in part is conceived to be a natural ſlothfulneſs and unwillingneſs unto any kinde of labour in this People; which they labour moſt of all to avoid, and are ſo wiſe, that they never will be brought to it, but upon good wages: but on the contrary, given to ſports very much, <hi>viz.</hi> ſinging, dancing, and drinking out of meaſure; in ſo much as 'tis thought, if it were not for their beloved liquor, they would hardly be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded long to take either the care or the pains of Husbandry. They are of ſtature reaſonably tall, dwelling both in Towns and Villages; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtinguiſhed into certain Clans or Tribes; each whereof is governed by one <hi>Chief,</hi> but all of them ſubject to the Judges and Officers of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> It contains in it theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Provinces, 1. <hi>Cinoloa.</hi> 2. <hi>Couliacan.</hi> 3. <hi>Xaliſco.</hi> 4. <hi>Guadalaiara;</hi> all of them on the Weſtern ſhore. 5. <hi>Zacatecas.</hi> 6. <hi>New-Biſcay:</hi> and 7. <hi>New-Mexico,</hi> more within Land.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Cinoloa</hi> is the moſt Northern part of <hi>New-Gallicia,</hi> bounded on the Weſt, with ſome part of the Gulf or Bay of <hi>Califormia:</hi>
                        <pb n="307" facs="tcp:170201:163"/>
On the Eaſt with a long ridge of Mountains, which they call <hi>Tepecſuan:</hi> On the North with <hi>Cibola;</hi> and with <hi>Couliacan</hi> on the South. The Country, beſide the general fertility of the whole Province of <hi>New Gallicia,</hi> yeelds great ſtore of Cotton-wooll, by reaſon whereof both Men and Women here are better appareld, for the moſt part, than elſewhere the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans are. Exceedingly well watered with Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, which deſcend from thoſe mountains <hi>Tepecſuan,</hi> not above thirty or fourty leagues diſtant from the Sea; and which, with the varietie of their ſtreams and Meandrous gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, doe divide the Country into many and good paſtures, which are likewiſe ſtored with aboundance of Kine, Oxen and other Cattel. The chief towns of the Spaniards are, 1. <hi>St. Philip</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſeated towards the Sea ſide, on the banks of a fair River, ſome thirty or fourty leagues diſtant from the town of <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liacan.</hi> 2. <hi>St. John de Cinoloa,</hi> an ancient Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonie of Spaniards, ſetled there by <hi>Franciſco de Tharra,</hi> in the year 1554, which is all they have in this Countrie; except ſome few old Forts of the Natives, which they found, after their manner, poorly furniſhed; but have ſince repaired them for defenſe againſt the Natives of thoſe parts, which as yet remain unreduced.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="308" facs="tcp:170201:164"/>3. <hi>Couliacan</hi> lyeth Southward of <hi>Cinoloa,</hi> coaſting all along the Bay of <hi>Califormia,</hi> which it hath on the Weſt. On the Eaſt it hath <hi>New-Biſcay:</hi> and on the South <hi>Xaliſco.</hi> The Countrie not defective in any kinde of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Proviſion, more eſpecially aboundeth with Fruits of all ſorts: But the Spaniards look only at the Mines; of which they have ſome few in this Countrie. The People were generally cloathed with Garments of Cotton-wooll, when the Spaniards came firſt among them, but yet never a whit the more modeſt; being exceedingly given to Venery, and that in a more ſhameleſs and beaſtly manner, than many other Americans were, that goe naked. The Spaniſh Towns are theſe, 1. <hi>Hiuſtula,</hi> ſeated on the banks of a fair River, diſtant about a dayes journie from the Sea. 2. <hi>Quinola.</hi> 3. <hi>Quatrabarrios,</hi> an old Town of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, but new named by the Spaniards. 4. <hi>El Leon,</hi> an old burrough. 5. <hi>Couliacan,</hi> the chief town of the Province. 6. <hi>St. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,</hi> in the Valley of <hi>Arroba,</hi> two leagues diſtant from the Sea, in a rich and plentifull Countrie both for Corn and fruit, and built by <hi>Nunnez de Guſman</hi> in the year 1531, after he had burnt the Towns, and deſtroyed a great part of the Natives, inhabitants of the Country.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="309" facs="tcp:170201:164"/>4. <hi>Xaliſco,</hi> or <hi>Galeſco,</hi> as ſome call it, is bounded on the North with <hi>Couliacan:</hi> On the South with ſome parts of <hi>New-Spain:</hi> On the Eaſt with the Province of <hi>Guadalaiara;</hi> and on the Weſt with the Gulf or Bay of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liformia.</hi> The Countrie chiefly fertil in <hi>Maiz</hi> and Mines of Silver; not altogether ſo apt for herbage and paſture, as ſome other Countries about it. The People were Cannibals, before the Spaniards came among them, and did eate Mans-fleſh; were much given to quarrelling and contentions among themſelves; but by this time 'tis ſuppoſed, are reaſonably well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed both from the one and the other. In this Countrie, beſide many other goodly ſtreams, is the great and famous River <hi>Bara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> on the banks whereof are ſeated moſt of their principall Towns, <hi>viz. Xaliſco,</hi> which gives name to the whole Province, and to a large Promontory or Foreland on the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern coaſts, which ſhoots it ſelf out into the Bay of <hi>Califormia,</hi> right over againſt certain Iſlands which the Spaniards call <hi>the Three Maries.</hi> This was an ancient Cittie or Town of the Natives; but ſacked and taken from them by <hi>Nunnez de Guſman,</hi> in the year 1530. 2. <hi>Compoſtella,</hi> now the chief City of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and a Biſhops Sea. 3. <hi>La Purification,</hi>
                        <pb n="310" facs="tcp:170201:165"/>
a ſmall Town on the Sea ſide towards the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of <hi>New-Spain.</hi> 4. <hi>St. Sebaſtians,</hi> in <hi>Chiametla,</hi> ſo called from the River upon which it is built; having rich Mines of ſilver round about it; and therefore made a Colony by <hi>Franciſcus de Tharra</hi> above mentioned, in the year 1554.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Guadalaiara,</hi> is bounded on the Weſt with <hi>Xaliſco;</hi> on the South, and South-weſt with <hi>New-Spain;</hi> on the North with <hi>Zaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecas.</hi> A Countrie exceeding pleaſant, and rich in all kinde of Commodities, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in its Mines of ſilver: Well watered with the River <hi>Barania,</hi> which runneth through the midſt of it, and with divers other ſtreams: Yeelding aboundantly, both Wheat, <hi>Maiz,</hi> and ſome other grain. In a word, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſaid of the properties of <hi>New-Gallicia</hi> in generall, either for Soile, Climate, or People, but is peculiarly verified of this Province. The chief Towns whereof are, 1. <hi>Guadalaiara,</hi> which gives name to the whole Province about it.

of it, if we may beleeve them, at leaſt in reſpect of what was generally found in theſe Northern parts of <hi>America</hi> at their firſt diſcovery; as namely, that they have Towns fairly and well built of Lime and Stone, hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of four ſtories high, and moſt of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with ſtoves for the winter ſeaſon, as well as any in <hi>Europe:</hi> The ſtreets fair and broad, and the People as curious and expert in divers Arts and Manufactures, as any of theirs.

Another called <hi>Acoma,</hi> a great Town, but ſeated on the top of an high Rock, without any ordinary way of acceſs to it, but by a pair of ſtaires, hewn out of the hard ſtone; or elſe by certain ladders which the Inhabitants let down and take up as they pleaſe.

About five hundred years agoe or more, according to the account of the Mexican Annals, divers Hoards or Swarms of theſe <hi>Chichimecae,</hi> wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it ſeems, of their Woods and ſubterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dwellings, iſſued out into the more open Aire, and fell down in huge multitudes into theſe Southerly parts of <hi>America,</hi> which are now called <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>New-Spain:</hi> not all at once, but at ſeveral times, and under ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral names, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Suchimilci, Chalcae, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panecae, Tlaſcaltecae,</hi> and others; who ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or driving out the People they found in thoſe parts, ſeated themſelves in their room: And though at firſt every Nation or Company of them, as they came, ſeized upon ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince apart by themſelves, and held it, as it were, in Soveraignty to themſelves, without acknowledgement of any dependance or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to their Neighbours, or thoſe that were there before them; yet in tract of time, and by fortune of the Warrs, which they made one upon another, they all fell under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one King, <hi>viz.</hi> the King of <hi>Mexico:</hi> which was the chief City of the Province. This Kingdome, at the time that the Spaniards firſt diſcovered the Countrie, was governed
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:170201:170"/>
by a Prince, named <hi>Motezuma;</hi> one, who by his valour and good ſucceſs in the warres, had in a few years of his reign, before the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards came thither, ſubdued the better part of a hundred Cities and great Towns to his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion; and held in actual ſubmiſſion to his Government, and tributary to him, no leſs than thirty ſeveral <hi>Caſiques</hi> or petty Princes; every one of which pay'd him Tribute, and were able upon occaſion to bring into the field an hundred thouſand men. He is ſaid to have been, for his perſon, a wiſe and good Prince, juſt, affable, and tender of his Subjects good: but by reaſon of ſome heavy exactions, which his own power and the practiſe of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors before him, gave him the confidence to impoſe upon the conquered People, a great part of his Subjects lived but unwillingly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his obedience, and rather by conſtraint than otherwiſe: being alſo further exaſperated againſt him by one barbarous cuſtome, which the Mexicans frequently uſed, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing of men. Their manner was, whenſoever they had any ſolemn occaſion of doing honour to their Devil-god <hi>Vitzilopuchtli,</hi> as they called him, to ſend out an Army of men from <hi>Mexico,</hi> into ſome of the ſubdued Provinces, (in caſe they had no enemies neerer hand)
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:170201:170"/>
and to fetch in as many men as they thought good, to be ſacrificed; whoſe fleſh likewiſe afterwards they did eate in a ſolemn Banquet. This being a buſineſs of their Satanicall Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and <hi>Motezuma</hi> a Prince extremely ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious and devoted to the ſervice of his gods, it is ſaid, that he ſacrificed commonly, one yeer with another, twenty thouſand men, and ſome yeers, upon extraordinary occaſions, not leſs than fifty thouſand: So great and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous a Tyranny, by the juſt judgement and permiſſion of Almighty God, for their great and unnatural ſins, did the Enemy of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde exerciſe upon them. He was likewiſe much given to Women; but it was only to ſuch as were counted his Wives; of which he is ſaid to have had no leſs than one hundred and fifty with child by him at one time.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Cortez,</hi> that fortunate Spaniard, who firſt conquered this rich and mighty Kingdom, ſoon diſcovered the diſcontents and ill affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which a great part of <hi>Motezumas</hi> People bare towards his Government; and reſolved to make his advantage of it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, being already landed in the Iſland <hi>Acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamil,</hi> or <hi>Cozamul,</hi> as 'tis often called, and having gained his firſt battel at <hi>Potonchan,</hi> and after that another at <hi>Cintla,</hi> where, with
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:170201:171"/>
a handfull of men (not above five hundred in all) ſome horſe, and a few pieces of Ordinance, he defeated an Army of fourty thouſand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, he quickly obliged thoſe of <hi>Zempoallan</hi> and <hi>Tlaſcaella</hi> to take part with him againſt <hi>Motezuma;</hi> and by their means divers others: as likewiſe they did, aſſiſting him both in his firſt march towards <hi>Mexico</hi> with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent number of Men, and at the ſiege and taking of it, with an Army of an hundred thouſand: In recompenſe whereof, they enjoy at this day many great Immunities and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges above the reſt of the <hi>Americans,</hi> and in a manner equall to thoſe of the Spaniards themſelves. <hi>Motezuma</hi> was ſo frighted with the ſucceſs of <hi>Cortez,</hi> and with the revolt of ſo many of his own Subjects from him, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially upon his gaining a third battel, and ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the rich town of <hi>Chololla,</hi> that at the firſt he freely admitted him into <hi>Mexico,</hi> and ſoon after without much conteſtation, acknow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledged himſelf Vaſſal to the Emperor and King of <hi>Spain;</hi> preſenting him in the nature of a Tribute, as much gold as amounted to one hundred and ſixty thouſand Caſtlins or pieces of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> which are ſaid to be nine ſhillings and ſeven pence a peece of common money. Nothwithſtanding, not long after, upon ſome
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:170201:171"/>
differences growing betwixt the Spaniards and People of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and that a Governor of <hi>Motezumas</hi> in the Country, named <hi>Qualpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poca,</hi> had put ſome Spaniards to death, <hi>Mote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zuma</hi> was confined to <hi>Cortez</hi> his houſe, and for the more ſecurity of his perſon, a pair of Gives or Fetters put upon his leggs; although he utterly diſclaimed the fact of <hi>Qualpopoca,</hi> and cauſed him with his Son and ſome others that were complices in the buſineſs, to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely burnt for it in the Market place of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and that by the ſentence of <hi>Cortez</hi> himſelf. The Mexicans, provoked with the injurie and indignity offered to their King, in the midſt of his Royal Citie, and in the ſight of his People, begin to mutiny and take Arms for the reſcue of their Prince. They beſiege the Spaniards in their houſe, together with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezuma,</hi> and preſs ſo hard upon them, that the Fetters are taken off, and <hi>Motezuma's</hi> help uſed for the allaying of the tumult, and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the People: and although they keep him ſtill under guard, yet they permit him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and diſpatch all affairs, as freely as if he were at liberty; to be attended by his Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and other Servants, in the full State and dignity of a King; only he went not abroad but ſome guard of Spaniards were with him.</p>

                        <pb n="324" facs="tcp:170201:172"/>3. About this time there were certain ſhips come to <hi>Vera Crux,</hi> which was a new Port town of this Countrie that the Spaniards had built ſince their coming thither, and had land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neer upon a thouſand men; which was an accident that had like to have ſpoiled the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of <hi>Cortez</hi> and all his Company at <hi>Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co:</hi> theſe men being ſent by <hi>James Velaſquez,</hi> Governour of <hi>Cuba,</hi> expreſsly againſt <hi>Cortez</hi> and his men, upon pretence that they acted not conformably to the Commiſſion which they had received from him; and gave him no account of their proceedings: which in a great part was true. For it muſt be confeſſed, <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tez</hi> and his men finding themſelves to have fallen upon an adventure that was certainly rich and good; and having got ſuch footing and intereſt in the Country already, by their ſucceſs and victories, and chiefly by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy with ſo many of the Natives and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Countrie revolted to them, did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by a general conſent, renounce their Commiſſion and dependency upon <hi>Velaſquez,</hi> and profeſſed to act immediatly from and for the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> What pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences they had for ſuch a reſolution, ſeemingly at leaſt irregular, is not ſo well known. What ever they were, they proceed in it, and the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:170201:172"/>
whole company, (excepting only ſome few who yet went along with the reſt) chooſe <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tez</hi> anew for their Commander in chief, and appoint likewiſe, by common conſent, all other Officers of Juſtice, both Civil and Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, among themſelves: and to give the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter colour at Court to their proceedings, they ſend <hi>Portocorrero</hi> and <hi>Monteio,</hi> two of their principalls, into <hi>Spain,</hi> with a rich and huge preſent, to the Emperour, both to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the State of the Country, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure immediate Commiſſion from his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, to proceed: after which they advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Mexico,</hi> as hath been ſaid. <hi>Velaſquez,</hi> at <hi>Cuba,</hi> underſtanding their proceedings, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored to intercept both their Meſſengers and Preſent, but could not: and therefore ſent <hi>Pamphilo Narvaez</hi> with eleven ſhips, and about nine hundred or a thouſand men, to apprehend <hi>Cortez</hi> and oppoſe his proceedings. This hapned about the time that the differences were but newly calmed betwixt the Spaniards and the People of <hi>Mexico;</hi> and though it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged <hi>Cortez</hi> to leave the City in a wavering and unſetled condition, yet he took ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that <hi>Motezuma</hi> ſtill remained under the guard of the Spaniards, as before, aſſiſted with ſome thouſands of their friends of <hi>Tlaſcalla;</hi>
                        <pb n="326" facs="tcp:170201:173"/>
and he himſelf taking the reſt and ſome few Spaniards along with him, with undaunted courage and reſolution, marched againſt <hi>Narvaez.</hi> And ſuch was his good fortune, that not only <hi>Narvaez</hi> became his priſoner, without much bloodſhed, but likewiſe all his Men joyned with him in his deſigne, through the favour of the Chancery, or ſupreme Court of <hi>St. Domingo,</hi> and by the procurement of the Licentiate <hi>Vaſquez de Ayllon,</hi> a Judge of it, who was ſent with <hi>Narvaez</hi> to accommodate the differences.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. With this recruit <hi>Cortez</hi> marches back again to <hi>Mexico;</hi> but at his comming findes things in a very bad condition. For the Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans were now in an abſolute Rebellion, and made open warre againſt the Spaniards; had block'd up thoſe in the Citie, together with their friends the Tlaſcaltecans, and either ſtopped up or poſſeſſed themſelves of all the Avennues by land or water: ſo that it was ſome time before <hi>Cortez</hi> could get in with his forces. But at laſt by advantage of the night, in which the Mexicans never uſe to fight, nor yet to keep any very good guard, he found a paſſage, and made ſhift to bring in his forces, to the great rejoycing and incouragement of his men within, who were very hard put to it
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:170201:173"/>
by the numerous Mexicans, and preſſed to yeeld themſelves, and deliver up <hi>Motezuma.</hi> But upon his coming they took heart again; and he with his freſh Companies ſallying out upon the Citizens, eaſily ſet them at further diſtance. But yet their numbers were ſuch, and ſo infinitely ſurpaſſing his, being called in from all parts of the Kingdome not revolted, and their reſolution ſuch to deſtroy or ſtarve the Spaniards, as they would neither admit, nor ſo much as hear of any terms of Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which <hi>Cortez</hi> profered them divers times: their general cry being nothing elſe, but <hi>Get you hence, deliver up the King;</hi> and calling them <hi>Enemies, Theevs, Robbers,</hi> and what not? and truly the condition of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards was ſuch, and the Mexicans had them ſo much in their power, if not to kill, yet at leaſt to ſtarve them, by reaſon of their infinite numbers, which dayly increaſed, and by being ſo much Maſters of the City both by land and water, and having broken down all, or moſt of the bridges, by which only there was paſſage out of it, that the Spaniards would gladly have been gone, if they durſt: but they knew, their but offering to leave the City would be their deſtruction. <hi>Mexico</hi> is built, like <hi>Venice,</hi> upon the water, in the midſt of an huge Lake, having
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:170201:174"/>
three only waies to enter it by land, which are upon three ſeveral Cauſeys, of a league, two leagues, and half a league long; and of but little breadth: on all other parts it is ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Lake, which by ſundry and large Channels enters and waters the Citie in all the quarters of it; where they have draw-bridges to pull up and let down at pleaſure. At theſe paſſes the Spaniards knew very well they ſhould be over-power'd by their enemies; who by this time were grown ſo reſolute and hardy, that they ſeem'd not to fear or regard death, but in fight would run deſperately in multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes even upon the mouths of the Ordinance: and doubtleſs but for the Horſ-men, which ſtav'd them off, they would in a ſhort time have rendred them in a manner uſeleſs, and have choak'd them up (as it were) with their own dead bodies. In this hurly-burly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs the Spaniards, whither by force or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, procured <hi>Motezuma</hi> (who was yet in their power) to appear above upon a Gallerie, or flat of roof the houſe, upon a pretence, that he ſhould offer ſom terms of accomodation from the Spaniards, and to ſhew himſelf to be well: But it was in a place where the ſtones and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows flew ſo thick from the enraged multitude below, that <hi>Motezuma</hi> himſelf received a
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:170201:174"/>
wound, by one of them, in his head, ſo unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, that within a few dayes after he dyed of it: as they ſay, who would not have the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards thought to have murder'd him; as the Mexicans ſay they did, with divers other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-men, and ſome of his Children, the very night they fled. However it were, not long after his death, out of extream neceſſity, and chiefly for want of Victuals, the Spaniards were forced to leave the City in the night time, and with the loſs of four hundred and fifty of their men, who were ſlain or taken priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners at the paſſing of a draw-Bridge; the reſt making a heavy retreat to their friends at <hi>Tlaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calla.</hi> There is ſtanding at this day in <hi>Mexico,</hi> upon the place where ſo many of them were killed, a certain Hermitage, which they call <hi>Los Martyres,</hi> or the Hermitage of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs; but <hi>very improperly,</hi> ſaith mine Author, their own Countriman: for what reaſon I ſhall not here enquire.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. This retreat of the Spaniards out of <hi>Mexico</hi> happened to be upon the tenth of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> after mid-night in the year 1520, which the Spaniards at <hi>Mexico</hi> call <hi>the dolefull night.</hi> Nevertheleſs the undaunted <hi>Cortez,</hi> being got, though with huge difficulty and trouble, by reaſon of the purſuit of the Mexicans for a

Wherefore having ſent for, and procured a competent ſupply of freſh Souldiers from <hi>St. Domingo,</hi> or <hi>Hiſpaniola, Almeria, Cuba,</hi> and other places, being in all nine hundred Foot, eight hundred Horſe, and ſeventeen pieces of Ordinance, he joyns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the Auxiliary Forces of <hi>Tlaſcalla,</hi> which were no leſs than an hundred thouſand men, armed with Bows and Arrows: and with this Army marches again towards <hi>Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> and beſieges it both by Land and Water, <hi>viz.</hi> with the help of thirteen <hi>Vergantines,</hi> or Galliots, which he had built upon the Lake, and ſix thouſand <hi>Canoas,</hi> or little Boats, which his friends and confederates had procured him. By which means, and by his Army on Land, in a ſhort time he cut off all Proviſion from the Citie, and after a ſiege of full three moneths or more; and a moſt ſtout and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate reſiſtance made by the People within, in which they are ſaid to have loſt above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

They ſpeak not of above fifty Spaniards ſlain during the whole ſiege, ſix horſes, and not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Tlaſcaltecans.</hi> In this manner, and with ſo little charges to the Conqueror, there fell to the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> the richeſt and goodlieſt Kingdome (one of them) of the whole World, <hi>viz.</hi> the Kingdome of <hi>Mexico,</hi> which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors preſently named <hi>New-Spain;</hi> and in reference to which name, the Catholike King hath ever ſince ſtiled himſelf in the plural <hi>Hiſpaniarum Rex,</hi> or King of both <hi>Spains:</hi> and all by the valour, prudence, admirable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and happy conduct of <hi>Cortez;</hi> who was at firſt but a private Adventurer in the American Plantations and diſcoveries, though otherwiſe a Gentleman of a good Familie in <hi>Spain,</hi> born at <hi>Medellin</hi> in the Countrie of <hi>Eſtramedura.</hi> The Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth, who was then alſo King of <hi>Spain,</hi> for his great ſervices endowed him deſervedly with many great and rich Territories in the Provinces of

it ſelf into the Gulf. The Country is reckoned to be about fifty leagues in length, and not much leſs in breadth; of a fruitfull Soile, having ſome Mines of gold in it, and once very Populous, till <hi>Hernando Cortez</hi> and the Spaniards, about the year 1522, diſpeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled it by their cruelty. The chief towns now remaining and inhabited by the Spaniards are, firſt <hi>St. Lewis de Tampice,</hi> a Colony of Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards ſituate on the Northern bank of the River <hi>Panuco,</hi> at the very mouth of it; where it hath a very large Haven, but ſo barred with ſands, that no ſhip of any great burden can enter or abide in it with ſafety; and yet the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver otherwiſe ſo deep, that Veſſels of five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred tun, might ſail up threeſcore leagues at leaſt within land, and thereby viſit the rich Mines of <hi>Zatatecas</hi> on the one ſide of it, and of <hi>New-Biſcay</hi> on the other, at pleaſure, and without fear of much oppoſition. 2. <hi>St. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van del Puerto</hi> on the South ſide of the ſame River, eight leagues diſtant from the Sea or Gulf of <hi>Mexico;</hi> at preſent the Metropolis or chief town of the Province, built by <hi>Cortez,</hi> in the place where ſtood old <hi>Panuco,</hi> which was likewiſe the Metropolis or head town of the Natives, before the Spaniards burnt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed it. 3. <hi>St. Jago de los Valles.</hi> This is

a Frontier place, and enjoyeth certain ſpeciar Immunities and ſome fair poſſeſſions alſo fo defenſe of the Country againſt the Savages.

The Country ſo excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly pleaſant and healthfull, that 'tis uſuall for ſick perſons of other Provinces to come hither to recover their health, only by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of a good Aire. The Soil ſo aboundantly fertil of all ſorts of grain, that of four mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſeed, it hath been often obſerved, they have reaped the next harveſt more than ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred meaſures of the ſame grain. Very well wooded; and by reaſon of its many Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and freſh ſprings equally rich in good pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture: and beſide great plenty of Medicinall
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:170201:179"/>
Hearbs and Plants. It affordeth good ſtore of Amber nigh the Sea Coaſts, Mulberry-trees, &amp; conſequently Silks; much Honey, wax and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Commodities, both for neceſſity and pleaſure. The People of the Country are generally tall, of a ſtrong active body, and a good wit, eſpecially in compariſon of other Natives: not unskilfull in divers curious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures; and the moſt excellent Feather-Picturers, aforementioned, are ſaid to be found in this Province. They ſeem more generally inclined to the humors and cuſtomes of the Spaniards, than many other Americans; and received the preaching of Chriſtian Religion, when time was, with much willingneſs: ſo that the Country is now entirely Chriſtian, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ſeveral Pariſhes. There are ſaid to be in it one hundred and fifty Towns or Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs (beſide many ſcattered Villages) moſt of which have free Schools erected in them, for the training up of youth in Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, good literature and Arts; and few of them without an Hoſpitall for the ſick, of which towns the principall are ſuch as follow, <hi>viz. Zinzoutza,</hi> the ſeat of the ancient Kings of <hi>Mechoacan.</hi> 2. <hi>Paſcuar,</hi> a City fourty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven leagues diſtant from <hi>Mexico,</hi> once a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Sea, but now removed to <hi>Valladolit.</hi>

3. <hi>Valladolit,</hi> the Metropolis or chief City of the Province, ſince the Epiſcopall chair was removed from <hi>Paſcuar</hi> thither. It lyeth upon a great Lake, equall almoſt for bigneſs to that of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and is about ſeven leagues diſtant from <hi>Paſcuar,</hi> towards the Eaſt. 4 <hi>St. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaels,</hi> a good town, fourty leagues Weſtward of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and in the way to the <hi>Zacatecas,</hi> but lying in a road that is ſomewhat dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, being not a little infeſted with Savages on both ſides of it. 5. <hi>St. Philips.</hi> 6. <hi>La Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception de Salaya,</hi> 17 leagues diſtant from <hi>Valladolid,</hi> and a convenient ſtage for Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers; being indeed, with the two laſt menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, built chiefly for the defence and ſecuring of the Country againſt the Savages. 7. <hi>Guaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nato,</hi> a Town on the borders of <hi>Panuco,</hi> where there are very rich Mines of ſilver. 8. <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> another Town likewiſe of very rich Mines, twenty four leagues diſtant from <hi>Valladolid,</hi> and threeſcore from <hi>Mexico.</hi> 9. <hi>Zamorra.</hi> 10. <hi>Villa de los Lagos,</hi> and others. Towards the Sea there is, 1. <hi>Acatlan,</hi> but two miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the Coaſt, and a ſmall town; yet by reaſon of a ſafe and very good Harbour which it hath for ſhipping, a place of no little trading. 2. <hi>Natividad,</hi> another well known and convenient Haven upon <hi>Mare del Zur,</hi>

pertaining to this Province, and from whence they uſually ſet ſail for the <hi>Philippine</hi> Iſlands. 3. <hi>St. Jago de buena Speranza,</hi> ſo called by the Spaniards, perhaps from the aboundance of good Pearls they found upon this Coaſt. 4. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyma.</hi> 5. <hi>Zacatula,</hi> and ſome others.</p>
                     <p>This Province, as we ſaid, was at firſt a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Kingdome of it ſelf, yet ſubordinate and tributary to that of <hi>Mexico;</hi> the King where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of named <hi>Tamgaivan Bimbicha</hi> (as <hi>Laet</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth) at the firſt coming of the Spaniards thither, after the conqueſt of <hi>Mexico,</hi> volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſubmitted himſelf to them, and was bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. Nevertheleſs afterwards, upon a pretence of I know not what Treaſon intended by him againſt them, and which the Spaniſh Writers themſelves profeſſedly think to have been feigned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by command of <hi>Nunnez de Guſman,</hi> Preſident of the Chancery of <hi>Mexico,</hi> he was moſt inhumanely burnt alive, and the Spaniards ſeized upon his Kingdome.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Mexicana,</hi> ſpecially ſo called, is bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Eaſt with the Gulf of <hi>Mexico;</hi> on the Weſt with <hi>Mechoacan:</hi> on the North with <hi>Panuco,</hi> and ſome parts of <hi>New-Gallicia;</hi> and on the South with <hi>Tlaſcalla:</hi> ſo called from <hi>Mexico,</hi> which is the chief City of the Province, and of all <hi>America</hi> beſide. A large
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:170201:181"/>
and rich Country, containing not much leſs than one hundred and thirty leagues both in length and bredth; and if it yeelds any thing to <hi>Peru</hi> in the plenty of gold and ſilver, 'tis certain, it much excells it in many other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities: as namely in all ſorts of Fruits, aboundance of Cattel, plenty of Corn and Grain; in all which the advantage which this Country hath, not only of <hi>Peru,</hi> but of all the other Provinces of <hi>America</hi> beſide, is well known: not to ſpeak any thing of the great plenty and variety of good Fiſh, which both the Rivers and Lakes of this Country afford, which is very great: inſomuch that the very tribute of the one Lake of <hi>Mexico</hi> is ſaid to yeeld an Income of above twenty thouſand Crowns yearly, one with another. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Country are generally induſtrious and active, eſpecially ſince the Spaniards came among them; rich Merchants, if they apply themſelves to it; and they ſay likewiſe good Souldiers, when they are trained and imployed that way. The chief towns and places of the Province are, 1. <hi>Mexico,</hi> both anciently and at preſent the Metropolis and Capitall City; being the ſeat of an Archbiſhop, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Reſidence of the Vice-Roy and chief Governours of <hi>New-Spain.</hi> Formerly it ſtood
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:170201:181"/>
like another <hi>Venice,</hi> upon the water, being built upon certain Iſlands within the Lake, and interlaced in all the quarters of it with divers pleaſant Currents, both of freſh and ſalt water. But the old City being deſtroyed by <hi>Cortez,</hi> as we ſaid, it was rebuilt by him more upon the firm Land, almoſt upon the banks of the great Lake; (for there are two of them, the one of ſalt-water, the other of freſh; which continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ebbe and flow into one another, &amp; contain in the compaſs of the whole, about thirty leagues or more: upon which there are thought to be not leſs than fourty or fifty thouſand <hi>Canoas</hi> or little Boats continually plying from one Town to another;) and in the midſt of a fair Plain, or Champaign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, containing likewiſe, as ſome ſay, not leſs than ſixty or ſeventy leagues in compaſs, and environed with mountains of ſo great height, that the tops of them are ſaid to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally covered with ſnow. At preſent it is thought to be one of the richeſt Cities of the World, abounding (if reports be true) in all kinde of voluptuous gallantry and bravery, even to exceſs: It is ſuppoſed to contain about ſix or ſeven miles in compaſs, and to conſiſt of above an hundred thouſand Houſes or Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereof not the tenth part Spaniards: but
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:170201:182"/>
thoſe that are, be all Gentlemen, I mean as to their garb and manner of living; for they live moſt ſplendidly in all reſpects, both for dyet and apparel. For the firſt, we have ſpoken ſo much already of the general plenty of all things in the Kingdom of <hi>New-Spain,</hi> that pertain to this part of pleaſure, that it is not to be doubted: and for the ſecond this may be ſome inſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is no extraordinary matter to ſee an Hat-band and Role all of Diamonds, in ſome ordinary Gentlemans Hat; and of Pearl among the common Citizens and Tradeſmen. The Coaches (which moſt Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen keep) almoſt covered with gold and ſilver, richly beſet with precious ſtones, and within ordinarily lined with cloth of gold, or the beſt <hi>China</hi> ſilk that can be gotten: of which Coaches, in time of year, at the <hi>Alameda,</hi> as they call it, which is, as it were, <hi>the Hide Park of Mexico,</hi> and a place made of purpoſe for recreation and delight, a man ſhall obſerve not ſeldome, above a thouſand or two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Coaches, full of Ladies and Gallants coming thither only to take the aire and their pleaſure, both the one and the other attended with a numerous train of ſervants and <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lattos</hi> of both ſexes. In <hi>la Plateria,</hi> which is but one only ſtreet in <hi>Mexico,</hi> nigh to the Vice-Roys
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:170201:182"/>
Palace, in leſs than half an hours ſpace, with the turn of an eye, you may ſee millions of wealth in Gold, Silver, and precious Stones, in the Gold-ſmiths and Jewellers ſhops there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts. In a word, there is nothing hinders <hi>Mexico</hi> from being the moſt abſolute Citie in the World for delight and bravery, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two inconvinces to which it is ſubject. The one is the danger of the Lake; with the Infalls whereof it may ſeem to be almoſt continually threatned, and in the year 1629, did actually ſuffer a very great calamity: the waters break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the banks, and drowning a great part of the City, with the deſtruction of much People, and the loſs of all their goods intirely, through the avarice (as is ſuppoſed) of the Vice-Roy that then was, and ſome other of the Kings Officers, who diverted the money that ſhould have been imployed, for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying and repairing of the banks, to their proper uſes. The other is from the Nature of the Soil and ground it ſelf, on which the City ſtandeth; which is found to have a tincture of of ſalt-Nitre in it, ſomewhat ſtrong; and the windes partly from the Lake it ſelf, and partly from the Hills about it, raiſing the duſt of this earth conſtantly every evening, for many moneths of the year together, ſo violently, that
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:170201:183"/>
the Aire is even darkned therewith for ſome time: the Inhabitants are much annoyed by it, and made ſubject to divers Hypocondriacall pains and infirmities, and ſometimes killed with it, eſpecially ſuch as either cannot or care not much to avoid it. The Citie lyeth about 60 leagues or one hundred and fifty miles diſtant from the Atlantick or North Sea; from whence by the Port of <hi>St. John D'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>llua,</hi> or <hi>Vera Crux,</hi> (which are the uſuall landing places) there is a fair and eaſie march to <hi>Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> by the Cities of <hi>Xalapa, Perotta, Puebla de los Angelos,</hi> and <hi>Tlaſcalla,</hi> all of them open and unfortified places (as likewiſe <hi>Mexico</hi> it ſelf is) and the Country round about very rich and well accommodated with all things. The ſecond town of this Province is <hi>Teſcuco,</hi> an ancient and fair Citie ſeated upon the ſame Lake ſix or ſeven leagues diſtant from <hi>Mexico,</hi> to which it yeeldeth not much either for beau-or bravery. 3. <hi>Quitlavaca,</hi> a Citie built wholly upon certain Iſlets within the Lake, and therefore called ſometimes by the Spaniards <hi>Venezuela,</hi> or <hi>Little-Venice,</hi> having one only paſſage by Land to it, over a Cauſey of flint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone half a league or more in length, and about ſixteen or twenty foot broad. 4. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ztacpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapa,</hi> a City of ten thouſand Houſholds or
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:170201:183"/>
thereabnuts, ſix leagues diſtant from <hi>Teſcuco,</hi> and about twenty from <hi>Mexico.</hi> 5. <hi>Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caltzingo</hi> a Burrough of four thouſand Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds. 6. <hi>Cuyacan,</hi> of ſix thouſand: All theſe are ſeated upon the Lake. Further from the Lake there is <hi>Chololla,</hi> a great Citie and a rich place, not much inferiour-to <hi>Mexico.</hi> Anciently this City was, as it were, the Sanctuary of the Mexican Kings, and the chief place of their barbarous and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Superſtitions, where yearly not leſs than five or ſix thouſand Indian Children of both ſexes were ſacrificed to <hi>Vitzilopuchtli,</hi> that is, to the Devil. It was likewiſe the chief burying place of all the Mexican Nobility, whoſe Tombs and Monuments there afforded the Spaniards at their firſt rifling of them, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite maſs of Treaſure; and yet not half ſo much, as by report, they both deſired and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. 2. <hi>Maſtitlan,</hi> a Town pleaſantly ſeated upon the top of an huge mountain, in the midſt of moſt delicate Groves and ſhady Woods round about it, and reckoned to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain not leſs than thirty thouſand Inhabitants in all, dwelling either in the Citie, or upon the ſides of the Mountain. 3. <hi>Autepecque,</hi> this is a Town belonging to the Marquiſs <hi>de Valle,</hi> who is of the Poſterity of <hi>Cortez,</hi> and
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:170201:184"/>
ſaid to be ſeated in the moſt delicious place of all <hi>New-Spain.</hi> 4. <hi>Acapulco,</hi> a Town ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the South-Sea, or <hi>Mare del Zur,</hi> yet belonging to this Province. It is a Haven Town and one of the moſt frequented upon the South Sea, ſituate upon a large and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Bay of about a league broad at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and affording many convenient ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Docks for ſhipping. At the bottome of the Bay Weſtward lyeth the Town, with a ſtrong Caſtle very opportunely built both for the command and ſecurity of the Port, well walled and fortifyed with Bulwarks, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a conſtant Garriſon of four hundred Souldiers in it, or thereabouts. The reaſon whereof I ſuppoſe may be chiefly this, <hi>viz.</hi> that from this Port there is the greateſt traffique and entercourſe held betwixt the Eaſt and Weſt-Indies, together with the <hi>Philippine</hi> Iſlands. The Country hath many rich Mines of ſilver in it, and ſome of Gold: the chief of which firſt are by <hi>Herera</hi> reported to be theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. thoſe of <hi>Puchuca,</hi> fourteen leagues diſtant from <hi>Mexico.</hi> 2. Of <hi>Taſco,</hi> twenty four leagues diſtant. 3. <hi>Talpuiana.</hi> 4. <hi>Cultepeque.</hi> 5. <hi>Zacualpa.</hi> 6. <hi>Zupan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guo,</hi> and divers others.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Tlaſcalla</hi> is a Province of <hi>New-Spain,</hi>
                        <pb n="349" facs="tcp:170201:184"/>
which extendeth it ſelf entirely from one Sea to another, <hi>viz.</hi> from the <hi>Atlantick</hi> to <hi>Mare del Zur,</hi> with which it is bounded on the Eaſt and Weſt parts; lying otherwiſe and for the moſt part betwixt the Provinces of <hi>Mexicana</hi> laſt ſpoken of, and that of <hi>Guaxata</hi> which followeth; containing in length, <hi>viz.</hi> from one Sea to the other, not much leſs than an hundred leagues, and in ſome places fourſcore in bredth; but towards the South-Sea growing much narrower. It is a Country exceedingly plentifull both of Corn and Cattel, full of rich paſturage, and ſo plentifully ſtored with <hi>Maiz,</hi> ſome Wheat, and other Grain, that it is counted, as it were, the Granary of <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi> The People of this Country, when the Spaniards firſt landed among them, lived in the form of a Common-wealth or Free State, refuſing to be ſubject to the King of <hi>Mexico,</hi> with whom they had almoſt continuall Warre; and upon that account, as hath been ſaid, aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted <hi>Cortez</hi> in the Conqueſt of the Kingdom: and without whoſe help 'tis moſt certain, he had never been able to doe any thing. They enjoy therefore many ſpeciall Priviledges and Immunities, more than other <hi>Americans</hi> doe. They pay no tribute but only an handfull of Wheat yearly for every perſon, in way of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:170201:185"/>
and otherwiſe living under the protection of the Spaniards, wholly in the form of their ancient Government. The whole Province is ſaid to contain two hundred good Towns and Burroughs, and more than one thouſand Villages, all of them exceedingly populous, and ſuppoſed to contain in the whole above a million and half of Natives, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide Spaniards, who have ſome few Colonies in the Country for ſecuring of it. The chief Towns of the Province are, 1. <hi>Tlaſcalla</hi> it ſelf, which denominates the whole Country as the Metropolis of it. It is a fair town, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly ſeated in the midſt of a large and fertil Campaign of threeſcore miles in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs. It conſiſteth of four large and beautifull ſtreets or quarters, and in the mideſt of them where they all meet, hath a <hi>Piazza,</hi> or Market place, equall to that of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and able to receive twenty or thirty thouſand perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently to buy and ſell in it. 2. <hi>Puebla de los Angeles,</hi> or the Citie of Angels, a town built by <hi>Sebaſtian Ramirez,</hi> a Church-man, and he that was the firſt preſident or chief Governour of <hi>Mexico,</hi> under the Crown of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> It was built in the year 1531, almoſt in the road way from <hi>Vera Crux</hi> to <hi>Mexico;</hi> and ſeated in a very delicate and fertil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:170201:185"/>
and of a good Aire. It is a Biſhops Sea, and valued at twenty thouſand Duckets of yearly Rent; the Citie it ſelf ſuppoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain about fifteen hundred Families; where there is aboundance of excellent cloath made, and for fineneſs not yeelding to the beſt of <hi>Spain.</hi> 3. <hi>Zempoallan,</hi> ſeated upon a River of the ſame name. 4. <hi>Napaluca.</hi> 5. <hi>Guaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingo:</hi> all of them great and ancient towns of the Natives. 6. <hi>Segura de la Frontera,</hi> a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh town, built by <hi>Cortez</hi> preſently upon the Conqueſt of <hi>Mexico,</hi> for the ſecuring of the confines, as the name importeth. 7. <hi>Vera Crux,</hi> a town built by <hi>Cortez</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, at their firſt landing; and where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, by a ſtratagem, and out of a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either to Conquer or dye in the Country, he cauſed all his ſhips to be burnt, that his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers might not ſo much as think of returning back from whence they came. The town was at firſt built five or ſix leagues up within land; but the place being found not to be ſo health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, the Inhabitants in a ſhort time deſerted it, and ſeated themſelves upon a Bay of the Sea right over againſt <hi>St. John D'ullua.</hi> 8. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dellin,</hi> another Spaniſh town, built likewiſe by <hi>Cortez,</hi> in memory of his own birth place; which was <hi>Medellin,</hi> a ſmall town of <hi>Eſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medura,</hi>

a Province of <hi>Spain.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>St. John D'ullua,</hi> a noted and the moſt uſuall Port to all this Province, and likewiſe to the City of <hi>Mexico</hi> it ſelf, from the North Sea: but of difficult entrance, eſpecially to ſuch as are not well acquainted with the paſſage, or want Guides; by reaſon of certain Rocks and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, wherewith the mouth of the Haven is ſaid to be barred: but within, the ſtation is more ſafe. It hath likewiſe two ſtrong Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks or Forts raiſed, on either ſide of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance one, to defend the paſſage.</p>

Nor is it leſs rich in Mines of gold and ſilver; there being ſcarſe a River in the whole Country, but the ſands of it are ſaid to be tinctured more

All which, if true, ſeems not a little to confirm the report which goeth for current in the Welch Chronicles, of one <hi>Madoc ap Owen</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Guineth,</hi> a Prince of that Countrie, who is ſaid to have fallen upon a farre Countrie this way in his travels; which he liked ſo well, that having ſecured to his Companions their ſafe abode there, during his

abſence, he returned himſelf into <hi>Wales</hi> for more Men; and that he tranſported thither as many as he could carry in ten Barks full la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.

It hath likewiſe good plenty of <hi>Cocchinele:</hi> but as for Mines either of gold or ſilver, I obſerve not much to be ſpoken; the Countrie is ſuppoſed to afford ſome, but hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto no great ſearch hath been made; poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly for want of Labourers to work in the Mines. The only inconvenience which the Countrie ſeemeth to lye under, is the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Serpents, or Snakes which it breedeth: there are ſome of them ſaid to be twenty foot long or more; and doe not a little infeſt the Natives: who yet are not without a general Antidote or Remedy which the Countrie like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe naturally affordeth: which is nothing elſe but the leaves of ſome of their trees dryed to powder; of which they make a plaiſter of ſoveraign efficacie, as 'tis ſaid, againſt their venome; and otherwiſe generally good for any old and inveterate ſores.</p>

                        <pb n="361" facs="tcp:170201:190"/>The places of more principall note in this Countrie inhabited by the Spaniards, are 1. <hi>Ciudad Real,</hi> pleaſantly ſeated in the midſt of a round Vale or Plain, and almoſt encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with Hills round about it, in form of an Amphitheatre; at the foot of one of which, ſtanding in the midſt of the reſt, the City is built. It is a Citie ſpecially priviledged by the Kings of <hi>Spain;</hi> of a pure and temperate Aire, and the Country about plentifully abounding both in Corn and Fruit. 2. <hi>Chiapa,</hi> which giveth name to the Valley aforeſaid; it is a Biſhops Sea, and famous, if but for one of its Prelates, <hi>viz. Bartholomaeus de las Caſas,</hi> of the Order of Preachers, who was Biſhop of this Citie, and his memory juſtly precious among the poor Americans at this day, for his Charity towards them, and for the ſtout and zealous oppoſition which he made againſt the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards cruel and inhumane dealings with the Natives at the beginning of their Conqueſts: by which at laſt, notwithſtanding much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and reſiſtance made by intereſſed perſons of the other ſide, he procured them liberty, and an Edict from the Emperor in favour of them; whereby they were declared to be <hi>Free Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and <hi>not Slaves;</hi> and the Spaniards for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to uſe them any longer as ſuch, or to
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:170201:191"/>
force them to any kinde of labour againſt their wills, or otherwiſe than by agreement with them, which liberty they enjoy to this day; and though the Spaniaiards are ſaid to give them very ſmall wages in ſome places, and for their work in their Sugar Mills (which is no ſmall labor) not above five Royalls or two Shillings ſix Pence a week, for the maintenance of themſelves, their Wives and Children, yet by reaſon, it is with their conſent, and in a Country where all things are plentifull and cheap: their condition is much better than it was, and the favour which that good Biſhop did them, never to be forgotten.

                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Vera paz,</hi> or the Country of <hi>True peace,</hi> was ſo named by the Spaniards, as they ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was never conquered by the Sword, but reduced to obedience only by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Dominican Friers. It is bounded on the Weſt and South-weſt with <hi>Chiapa;</hi> on the Eaſt with ſome part of <hi>Guatimala,</hi> and <hi>Honduras,</hi> and on the North with <hi>Jucatan,</hi> It Containes about thirty leagues length, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:170201:191"/>
as much in breadth, being a woody and mountainous Country for the moſt part, yet well diſtinguſhed with Valleys and lower grownd. It is thought to be a little too much ſubject to rain, which 'tis ſaid to have for nine moneths of the year almoſt continually; by reaſon whereof the Country, being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hot, is much anoyed with a kind of <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit,</hi> or great ſort of Gnatts, which ſpoyle the fruit very much, and are otherwiſe not a little troublſome to the people. The chief Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of this Country, are firſt a kinde of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which ſome call <hi>liquid Amber,</hi> which drops from divers of their trees, and is ſaid to be a Commodity very precious and of much uſe. <hi>Maſtick, Sazaparilla, China wood,</hi> and divers other Medicinall woods, which it affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in great plenty. But as for any Towns or places of much Traffique or note, inhabited by the Spaniards; I finde not any named, ſave only <hi>St. Auguſtines;</hi> neer unto which, there is ſaid to be a Cave and Fountain within ground, which converts the water that falleth into it, out of ſeveral leſſer Springs, into a kinde of Alablaſter, or ſtone perfectly white, and faſhions it likewiſe into pillars, ſtatues, and other artificiall formes very curiouſly, as <hi>Laet</hi> reporteth.</p>

the year 1586. it was almoſt buried with aſhes and burnt Earth, which the one of them, for the ſpace of ſix moneths together, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alled belched out in ſuch fearfull quantity, that many people were ſlain, and the City re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived much damage by it. There are many of theſe <hi>Vulcans</hi> in ſeverall parts of <hi>America,</hi> as namely at <hi>Arequipa</hi> in the Kingdome of <hi>Peru,</hi> at <hi>Puebla de los Angeles,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Tlaſcalla</hi> aboveſaid; a Mountain of ſo great height, that they are ſaid to goe little leſs than thirty leagues, turning and winding, before they can reach the top of it, and others in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall other places. They are generally Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of great height, and running ſharp up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but at the top containing ſome quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of plain and level grownd; in the midſt whereof is the pit or hole, out of which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of ſmoak and fiery aſhes are vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted almoſt continually, and ſo deep, that they are ſuppoſed for the moſt part to reach to the very bottom of the Mountain.

The Countrie is for the moſt part Mountainous, and the Soil outwardly but barren, but recompencing all defects with the aboundance of its more inward wealth.

                     <p n="1">1. THe new Kingdome of <hi>Granada,</hi> as 'tis commonly called, was for the moſt part both diſcovered and conquered by <hi>Gonſalvo Ximenes,</hi> about the yeare 1536, and with ſo good ſucceſs that in leſs than a years ſpace, the whole Country was quietly ſetled under the Spaniards government, and the Captain with his Small Company had made ſhift to gather together ſuch a maſs of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:170201:202"/>
as may ſeem almoſt incredible, <hi>viz.</hi> from the <hi>Reguli,</hi> or petty Princes of thoſe Countries, whom he had either deſtroyed or made Tributary. <hi>Laet</hi> caſteth up the ſumme thus, one hundred ninty one thouſand, two hundred ninty four <hi>Pezos</hi> of abſolute fine Gold, thirty ſeven thouſand of Gold leſs fine, and eighteen thouſand of the courſeſt ſort of all. Of Emralds great and ſmall eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeen hundred, beſides aboundance of other rich booty. The Country is bounded on the North with <hi>Caſtella aurea</hi> aforeſaid; on the Weſt with <hi>Mare del Zur;</hi> on the Eaſt with <hi>Venezuela;</hi> the Southern parts of it being not yet well diſcovered, by reaſon of certain huge and unpaſſable Mountains, which block it up wholly on that ſide, ſave only where a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage is kept open into the Province of <hi>Peru,</hi> ſpecially ſo called. It containeth in length a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one hundred and thirty leagues, and not much leſs in breadth, being for the moſt part a very healthfull Country, and abounding in Mines of the beſt ſort of Metal, beſide others of Braſs and Iron. It is ſubdivided into theſe two Provinces, <hi>viz. Granada,</hi> ſpecially ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and 2. <hi>Popayana.</hi>

to much heat, nor to extremity of cold: the reaſon of this may ſeem to be its neerneſs to the Line, from which it is diſtant North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward but a very few degrees. The Country ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding fruitfull both of Corn and Cattel, affording rich paſturage, and many great heards of Cattel, many good Mines, as well of Gold as other Metals; and in that part of it which is called <hi>Tunia,</hi> as great plenty of the faireſt ſort of Emralds. Some parts of it are woody; and among other ſorts very good, both for Timber and Feuel. there is one which the Natives call <hi>Guaiacum,</hi> a medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable wood, and of ſoveraign uſe, they ſay, for thoſe that are ſubject to the <hi>Lues Venerea,</hi> and ſuch like Maladies. The People of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try generally tall of ſtature, and of a ſtrong conſtitution, but much more given to ſport and paſtime, than to any kinde of labor or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry. The Towns and places of cheif impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance are, 1. <hi>St. Foy,</hi> commonly called <hi>St. Foy de Bagota,</hi> which was the old name of this Province, and to diſtinguiſh it from another <hi>St. Foy</hi> in the Country of <hi>New-Mexico,</hi> as was ſaid. It is the Metropolis and Capitall City of this Province, an Arcbiſhops ſea, and the ordinary reſidence of the Governor; built by <hi>Gonſalvo Ximenes</hi> a Spaniard Native of

The Country is ſaid to be a little too much ſubject to rain, yet not ſo, but that the fertility of the ſoil anſwers the induſtry of the Inhabitants in moſt parts very well. The places of chief note in it are, 1. <hi>Popayan,</hi> ſituate on the banks of a fair Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but not named, and in the midſt of a Plain, in a place of great wealth, and enjoying a good aire.

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the Kingdome of <hi>Peru.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>PEru,</hi> in the Southern part of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> was anciently a great and mighty Kingdome, as <hi>Mexico</hi> in the Northern, and fell under the power of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> much after the ſame manner, that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Mexico</hi> did, <hi>viz.</hi> through the diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and differences among the People them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: The manner and occaſion briefly thus. <hi>Huayna Capac,</hi> the laſt <hi>Inca,</hi> or King of <hi>Peru,</hi> had, beſide many others, two Sons which he chiefly loved; the one by a lawfull Wife his neer Kinſwomen, called <hi>Huaſcar:</hi> the other by a Concubine named <hi>Atabalipa;</hi> betwixt whom, at his death, he divided his Kingdome; ſetling the one, <hi>viz. Atabalipa,</hi> at <hi>Quito,</hi> and making him King of all the Provinces belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, and which, for the moſt part, himſelf had conquered; and the other, <hi>viz. Huaſcar,</hi> at <hi>Cuſco,</hi> making him King of <hi>Peru,</hi> and of the Provinces about it, at a diſtance of five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred leagues one from another, thereby lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to either of them a Dominion large enough, if reaſon could have ſatisfied ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:170201:205"/>
But <hi>Huaſcar</hi> reſted not long content, diſdaining that a Baſtard-Brother ſhould ſhare ſo much with him in his Kingdome, contrary to the more juſt intereſt of ſome of his other Brothers, and to the cuſtom of the <hi>Incas</hi> his Anceſtors, who alwaies ruled as Monarchs, not admitting any diviſion of their Kingdoms. Hereupon differences and emulations ariſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two Brothers; <hi>Atabalipa,</hi> King of <hi>Quito,</hi> is commanded to appear at <hi>Cuſco,</hi> both to aſſiſt at the Funeral ſolemnities of <hi>Huayna Capac</hi> their Father, and to doe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage for his Kingdome; which he doth not refuſe: only deſireth the King his Brother not to oblige him to come ſo far, and through Countries ſo unſafe, without an attendance ſuitable to a King, and that might ſecure his journey: which pretence of his was not thought unreaſonable. So he brings along with him an Army of thirty thouſand men; which, through the negligence and too much ſecurity of <hi>Huaſcars</hi> Officers of Warre, was permitted to come ſo neer <hi>Cuſco,</hi> that with it, after ſome Battels fought, he taketh priſoner <hi>Huaſcar</hi> himſelf, King of <hi>Peru,</hi> puts to death all the <hi>Incas,</hi> or Children of the Blood Royal, that he could get into his power; and in this manner, for ſome time, holds the Kingdom,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:170201:206"/>
though not without much difficulty, by reaſon of the hatred which the people generally bare towards him, for his cruelty towards the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Progenie; and the oppoſition which divers of <hi>Huaſcars</hi> Captains made againſt him in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Things being in this condition at <hi>Cuſco</hi> among the Natives, the Spaniards that were at <hi>Panama,</hi> having reſted there full fifteen yeers ſince the Conqueſt of <hi>Mexico,</hi> without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any further diſcovery upon the South Sea than the <hi>Iſlands of Pearls,</hi> which lye not above ſixteen or ſeventeen leagues off from <hi>Panama,</hi> reſolve, about this time, to make ſome further ſearch of the Continent by Sea. The buſineſs was undertaken chiefly by one <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſco Pizarro,</hi> born at <hi>Truxillo</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> a Man of but mean parentage and fortune, but yet a good Souldier, and <hi>Diego Almagro,</hi> a rich Merchant of <hi>Panama.</hi> At firſt they met with many difficulties and diſcouragements in the Deſign; <hi>Pizarro</hi> being full eight moneths at Sea, ſailing of that courſe, which now, having better knowledge of the Countrie, they eaſily diſpatch in fourteen or fifteen dayes, his men ſome of them dying, and others deſerting the ſervice, though with the apparent hazzard of their lives: ſo that at eight moneths end he
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:170201:206"/>
found himſelf only with fourteen Men in a poor Iſland, and in the moſt deſtitute conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that could be. Yet being himſelf of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted courage and reſolution, and thoſe few men he had with him of the ſame minde with himſelf, they all reſolved rather to dye than to give over the Deſign. So putting again to Sea, they fall at laſt into the River of <hi>Tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bez,</hi> which in a few dayes brings them to a town and fortified place called likewiſe <hi>Tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bez</hi> where they found Inhabitants and a place moſt agreeable to their deſires, <hi>viz.</hi> where they found good plenty of Gold; for which, not being in a condition to fight, they were content at preſent to ſeem Merchants; and ſo for a few petty Commodities which they had brought with them, of no value, 'tis ſaid they received of the Natives the full quantity of thirty thouſand <hi>pezos</hi> of pure gold; which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived their ſpirits not a little. Whereupon finding the Countrie to be good and likely to afford much Treaſure, they return back again to <hi>Panama,</hi> make declaration of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie they had diſcovered, and ſollicite for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther licenſe to ſubdue and conquer it. Which having obtained, <hi>Pizarro,</hi> with four other of his Brothers, ſtout and reſolute men like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, a competent number of ſhips, and about
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:170201:207"/>
two hundred Souldiers, proſecute the Deſign, and appear at <hi>Cuſco</hi> with their little Army, juſt at the time that the differences there were hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, and that <hi>Huaſcar</hi> the King was newly become priſoner to his Brother <hi>Atabalipa:</hi> who, although at firſt he ſeemed to contemn the ſmall numbers of the Spaniards, and count them little better than mad-men, that would venture ſo farre into a ſtrange Countrie, no better provided than he took them to be, and upon ſuch an extravagant pretence, as that ſeemed to him, which they told him was the cauſe of their coming; yet after a while, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard the noiſe of their Ordinance, and a little taſted how ſharp their Swords were, he was content to become priſoner himſelf. The Spaniards at firſt treated him well, and put him in ſuch hopes of liberty, that out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to gain it, and that he might enjoy the Kingdome, though tributary to the Spaniards, himſelf alone, he cauſed his Brother the King <hi>Huaſcar</hi> to be put ſecretly to death, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the matter to the Spaniards, as if it had been done againſt his will; which, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending other matters, did not much examine. To obtain his liberty, he offered the Spaniards to give them the room wherein they were, filled up with gold and ſilver as high as a Souldier
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:170201:207"/>
could reach with the point of his ſword; and, as ſome ſay, performed it, at leaſt the greater part of it: Yet were the Spaniards ſo farre from granting him liberty, according to his expectation and their promiſe, that not long after they took away his life, moſt baſely ſtrangling him in priſon, after they had received him, as 'tis credibly reported, above ten milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of gold and ſilver together: upon preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces indeed of Treaſon, and ſome dangerous plottings againſt them, by <hi>Atabalipa</hi> and his People; (a criminal piece of Treaſon doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, for a poor Prince, injuriouſly impriſoned, to endeavour his liberty, and his ſubjects to aſſiſt him the beſt they could!) Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, the Spaniſh Writers themſelves doe generally diſlike the Fact, and ſome of them with deteſtation enough. <hi>God, the righteous Judge,</hi> (ſaith mine Author <hi>Lopez Vaz) ſeeing this villanous Act, ſuffered none of thoſe Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards to dye by the courſe of nature, but brought them all to evil and ſhamefull ends.</hi> Which was very true: for although upon the death of <hi>Atabalipa,</hi> the Spaniards held themſelves for Maſters of the Countrie, and <hi>Pizarro</hi> quickly obtained of the Emperor to be made a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs; yet long it was before the Indians could be wholly ſubdued, <hi>Mango Inga,</hi> the
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:170201:208"/>
Brother of <hi>Atabalipa</hi> making a ſtout and ſharp reſiſtance for a good while together, defeating the Spaniards in three or four ſeveral encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (in which <hi>Diego</hi> and <hi>John Pizarro</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the Marqueſs were ſlain) and twice taking the Citie of <hi>Cuſco</hi> from them by force. And when at laſt he happened to be overcome, and driven to fly to the Mountains, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, <hi>viz. Almagro</hi> and <hi>Pizarro,</hi> to whom the Emperor had given the command of the Countrie in ſeveral, fall out among themſelves, chiefly about the bounds of their reſpective Dominions, Civil Warres enſue betwixt them: in which firſt of all <hi>Almagro</hi> is taken priſoner by <hi>Pizarro,</hi> ſentenced to death, and executed without mercy; and not long after <hi>Pizarro</hi> himſelf murdered in his own houſe, by a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard ſonne of <hi>Almagro</hi> named <hi>Diego;</hi> who thereupon had the confidence to take upon him the government, and to encounter the Licentiate <hi>Vacca de Caſtro,</hi> the Emperors Commiſſioner, in the open field; where being worſted and taken, he afterward loſt his head at <hi>Cuſco.</hi> After this, <hi>Blaſcus Nunnez Vela</hi> being made Vice-Roy of <hi>Peru,</hi> and governing ſomewhat ſeverely, <hi>Gonzales Pizarro</hi> the fourth Brother, rebelleth, with many Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards with him; againſt whom <hi>Vela Nunnez,</hi>
                        <pb n="397" facs="tcp:170201:208"/>
the Vice-Roy's Brother, is ſent; but to little purpoſe, being taken priſoner by the Pizarriſts, and put to death. This ſo incenſeth the Vice-Roy, that himſelf in perſon marcheth againſt the Rebells, but to his own ruine. For a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle being fought in the fields of <hi>Quito,</hi> the hated Vice-Roy had the ill hap to be made priſoner, and by <hi>Carvaial,</hi> Lieutenant to <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarro,</hi> preſently, without further proceſs, cauſed to dye, in revenge, as 'tis ſuppoſed, for his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom the Vice-Roy, among many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, had lately ſentenced to death. <hi>Pizarro</hi> after this defeats <hi>Centenus,</hi> another General of the Emperors; but was at laſt, by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor <hi>Gaſca,</hi> defeated himſelf, taken priſoner, and beheaded for his Rebellion, together with <hi>Carvaial</hi> his Lieutenant, and divers other of his Complices: ſo that there remained now of all the five Brothers <hi>Pizarri,</hi> only <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> alive, who, as ſome report, was ſent pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner into <hi>Spain,</hi> by the Emperours Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner; others ſay, that his Brother the Marqueſs ſent him thither with the proceſs concerning <hi>Almagro's</hi> death. However, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that in <hi>Spain</hi> he dyed a priſoner. <hi>Martin de Alcantara,</hi> half-brother to the Marqueſs, was murdered with him in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs's houſe; <hi>Garcia Alvarado</hi> was ſtab'd to
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:170201:209"/>
death by one of the Almagriſts; and what became of <hi>Pedro Baldivia,</hi> with ſome others, ſhall be ſhewed in the deſcription of <hi>Chile.</hi> Thus periſhed, by the juſt hand of God, and through their own mutual diſſentions, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and covetouſneſs, thoſe firſt Coquerors of <hi>Peru, viz. Pizarro</hi> and his Companions; none of them all leaving ſo much as a good name behind him: and of their iſſue little is ſpoken. The Marquiſs himſelf is ſaid to have had a ſonne by a ſiſter of <hi>Atabalipa,</hi> whom they call <hi>Donna Angelina,</hi> but he dyed young; and whether he were legitimate or no, it may be doubted. But the Factions of the Pizar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts and Almagriſts being extinct, by the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and moderation of ſucceeding Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, the affairs of <hi>Peru</hi> came by degrees to be better ſetled, &amp; the People, either willingly, or by conſtraint, were perſwaded to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Spaniſh Government, and to live quietly in moſt parts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.</p>

In the <hi>Hill-Country,</hi> Their Summer begins in <hi>Aprill,</hi> as is ſaid, and ends in <hi>September;</hi> but in the <hi>Plaines,</hi> it begins in <hi>October</hi> and ends in <hi>May.</hi> So that in the ſpace of one day a man may taſt both Summer and Winter; be ſcorchd with exceſſive heate in the morning, and yet well nipt with cold before night. The <hi>Andes</hi> generally are covered with thick Woods and wild Foreſts; the <hi>Hill-Country</hi> for a great part naked and open; the <hi>Plains</hi> in many places ſandy and dry, and would be much more ſcorched with heat, then they are, but for the neighbourhood of the Sea, which affords them many cooling gales from the South and South-weſt windes; whoſe property, although it be naturally in other parts to be tempeſtuous, to bring rain and foul weather, yet here there is nothing but Serenity and fair Sun-ſhine dayes all the year long, although theſe windes blow almoſt without ceaſing upon the Country,

and no other at any time, whereas the <hi>Sierra</hi> or Hill countrys have winde from every coaſt, and ſuch as bringeth all ſorts of weather with it, Rain, Hail, Froſt, Snow, great claps of Thunder, &amp;c. The Countrie affordeth not ſo much Cattel of the breed of <hi>Europe</hi> as ſome other Provinces of <hi>America;</hi> but inſtead of theſe, both the Woods and Paſtures are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed, with great multitudes of the <hi>Vicug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> and <hi>Pacos</hi> above mentioned, which are of no leſs profit &amp; ſervice. The <hi>Pacos</hi> here are ſaid to be as big as ſome young Heifer of two yeers old, bearing a fleece like Sheep, and their fleſh no leſs pleaſant than the Mutton of <hi>Europe.</hi> But the great wealth of this Countrie lyes out of ſight, in the bowels of the Earth, <hi>viz.</hi> in thoſe rich and, as they may ſeem, inexhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible Mines both of gold and ſilver, which, as 'tis well known, this Countrie of <hi>Peru</hi> afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, more than any other Province of <hi>America</hi> beſide. The People are ſaid to be, at leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriorly, of greater ſimplicity than ſome other Americans, both in point of behavior and judgement, yet of good courage in the warrs and fearleſs of death: They are noted alſo to be diſſemblers, and not alwaies to declare their mindes truly and plainly; and which is worſe than all, to have bin given over to that foul ſin

<pb n="412" facs="tcp:170201:216"/>
ſhould build themſelves a Palace in that Citie where the Palace Royall was. The <hi>Incas</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace here was juſtly counted one of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the World: it was built on the top of a very high Mountain, on the North ſide of the Citie, walled round about, and for the moſt part of it, with three ſeveral walls all of maſſy ſtones, and thoſe of ſuch huge ſtupendious bigneſs, yet moſt exactly laid together and fitted one with another, that the Spaniards, conſidering the Indians had neither Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Iron, or any thing elſe to poliſh and faſhion them, nor Engins to draw them up to that height, nor ſo much as Carts to fetch them from the Quarries and places where they were found, which was eight or nine leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and over no ſmall Rivers, ſaid plainly, 'twas the work of the Devil, and not of Man, to lay them there: which ſeeming a thing not ſo eaſily to be ſuppoſed, I muſt, for my part, as plainly confeſs, 'tis a Problem ſomewhat above my capacity at preſent to reſolve, <hi>viz.</hi> how it ſhould come to paſs, that not only here, but in divers other parts of the Countrie, where the <hi>Incas</hi> and their Nobility had their Palaces, ſuch evident Monuments of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Art and Skill ſhould be found among a People ſo abſolutely ignorant
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:170201:216"/>
and unacquainted with Art, as the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans were reported to be. It is now quite demoliſhed, and converted to private dwellings; only the walls are permitted to ſtand, as well to teſtifie the greatneſs of the ancient ſtructure, as becauſe the ſtones thereof (as mine Author <hi>Laet</hi> reporteth) are ſo hugely ponderous &amp; big, that the Spainards know not well how to remove them, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps dare not venture upon it. Many other Monuments there were of the <hi>Incas</hi> Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence &amp; greatnes, as beſide their Temples which were very ſtately and rich.

of the Palace wainſcoted and ceiled with Gold; beſide an infinite number of Birds, Beaſts, Fowles, Serpents and other creatures, carved and wrought all of Gold or Silver. Nor was it otherwiſe in due proportion, in the Palaces of the Nobility: all were found ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mably wealthy and rich: And yet 'tis thought, what they found above ground, was nothing, in compariſon of that which they met with in the ranſacking of Cellars, Vaults, and other ſubterraneous places, where the poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Peruvians had endeavoured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey it out of ſight; which was ſuch that to this day, they ſay, thoſe treaſures are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, but that in digging upon occaſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground, they ſtill chop upon ſome good quantities of concealed Metals. The City at preſent is thought to contain ſome thirteen or fourteten thouſand Inhabitants, whereof the third part only Spaniards, the reſt Natives. 7. <hi>St. Franciſco de la vittoria,</hi> a Colony of Spaniards ſituate at the foot of the <hi>Andes,</hi> twenty leagues diſtant from <hi>Cuſco.</hi> 8. <hi>St. Juan del oro,</hi> another Colony in the Valley of <hi>Caravaya,</hi> neighboured with rich Mines of the pureſt Gold of <hi>Peru.</hi> Beyond which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, more towards the <hi>Andes,</hi> there are ſaid to lie certain Countries as yet undiſcovered,

much famed for gold Mines, but of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſable difficulty, that hitherto the Spaniards, though divers times attempting it, have not been able to effect any thing anſwerable to their deſires.</p>

The Country generally plain, commodiouſly watered in all parts with freſh Rivers, and conſequently affording rich paſturage and good heards of Cattell. It is thought to be the moſt populous Country of all <hi>Peru;</hi> what through the ſoundneſs and good temperature of the aire, what through the richneſs and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of the Soil. The chief Towns and places of note in it, being 1. <hi>Chuquinga,</hi> a great Town, and held to be naturally almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable, as being environed round about, either with deep unfordable Waters, or with Mountains unpaſſable, and having one only Cawſey leading to it, reported to be for two or three leagues together no broader than to

It is ſuppoſed to be fourſcore leagues diſtant likewiſe from the South Sea, having only one Eſtuary or Mouth, which is ſomething ſtreit, but of ſuch a deep water and violent ſtream, that, as <hi>Acoſta</hi> teſtifieth of it, it is not poſſible to build a Bridge of ſtone, or timber over it. But the Natives inſtead thereof have laid a Bridge of ſtraw upon it, which ſerves as well; <hi>viz.</hi> ſo many great bundles of ſtraw ſedge or ſuch like matter, well and ſurely made up, and faſtened together, as will reach from one ſide or bank of the Eſtuary to another; at which likewiſe having made them ſure, they caſt ſome good quantity of more ſtraw and

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. FOllowing the coaſt of <hi>Mare del Zur,</hi> or the South Sea, the next Province pertaining formerly to the Kingdome of <hi>Peru,</hi> is that of <hi>Chile.</hi> This is the moſt Southerly Province of the whole Country of <hi>America,</hi> reaching up as far as <hi>Magallanes</hi> Streits, with which to the Southward it is bounded: North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it hath a Deſart, and undiſcovered Country, lying betwixt it and the confines of <hi>Peru</hi> called <hi>Atacama:</hi> on the Weſt it hath <hi>Mare del Zur,</hi> and on the Eaſt up to <hi>Rio de la Plata,</hi> the Atlantick or North Sea, with ſome Countries undiſcovered, which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe betwixt it and <hi>Paraguay</hi> to the North-Eaſt. It lyeth all of it beyond the Tropique of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> in a temperate Zone, and extendeth it ſelf in length from the borders of <hi>Peru,</hi> to the mouth of the Streits five hundred leagues or more; but the breadth of it neither equall nor certain. They ſay 'tis called <hi>Chile</hi> from the word <hi>Chil,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>cold;</hi> it ſeems
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:170201:221"/>
in their language as well as ours, it being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally a cold and bleak Country, the aire in many parts of it ſo extremely ſharp and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, that both Horſe and Rider ſometimes in travelling are frozen to death, as the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards found by experience in their firſt ſearch and diſcovery of the Country, under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Diego Almagro,</hi> who is ſaid to have left the greateſt part of his men dead behinde him in this manner. But this is chiefly towards the <hi>Andes,</hi> and on the Sea coaſt; the more inland parts of it, though mountainous alſo in ſome parts, yet are more temperate, and being alſo well watered with Rivers, are much more fruitfull than the other, affording both Wheat, and <hi>Maiz,</hi> and likewiſe other grain, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Paſturage in many places and great ſtore of Cattel, Wine, Honey, not without many &amp; rich Mines both of Gold and Silver. The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of this Country were found the moſt ſtout and warlike of all the Americans, the Spaniards had hitherto met withall, fighting with them and oftentimes defeating them in the open field ſurpriſing and ſacking their Towns, and laſt of all taking their Captain and Commander in chief Priſoner. This was <hi>Pedro Baldivia,</hi> one of thoſe good men that conſented to the death of <hi>Atabalipa</hi> the laſt
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:170201:222"/>
King of <hi>Peru,</hi> after a greater ranſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted and paid, than perhaps the King of <hi>Spain</hi> could well raiſe on a ſudden, if he had occaſion to uſe it for himſelf. The <hi>Araucans</hi> (for ſo are the People called that had him pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner) are ſaid to have entertained him for a while gallantly, making him a feaſt; but for his laſt draught give him a cup of melted gold, which the poor man was forced to take down, and ſo dyed.</p>
                     <p>The whole Province generally is divided firſt into <hi>Chile,</hi> ſpecially ſo called; and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Magellanica,</hi> or that part which lyeth more Southward down to the Streits of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Chile,</hi> properly ſo called, is bordered Northward with the Deſart and barren Countrie of <hi>Atacama</hi> above mentioned; on the South with <hi>Magellanica;</hi> on the Weſt with <hi>Mare del Zur;</hi> Eaſtward and to the North-Eaſt with ſome parts of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raguay,</hi> or rather with ſome undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered Countries, lying betwixt them both. The length of it from North to South is recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be little leſs than three hundred leagues, and generally of a fruitfull Soile, affording beſide aboundance of gold and ſilver, both Corn, Cattel, Vineyards, and divers ſorts of
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:170201:222"/>
Fruits, equall both for kinde and plenty to <hi>Spain</hi> it ſelf, and ſundry other parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> The Aire likewiſe for the moſt part temperate, and the People, in their manners and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons approaching much neerer to the Civility and likewiſe ſubtilty of Europeans, than other Americans did: which doubtleſs may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the conformity of the Climates under which they lye, agreeable to thoſe of <hi>Europe;</hi> though otherwiſe in reſpect of the ſphere and ſeaſons of the yeer, there be Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricall difference betwixt us, as for example, their Spring beginning in <hi>September,</hi> which is our Autumn; and their Autumn in <hi>March,</hi> which is our Spring: their longeſt day being that of <hi>St. Lucy</hi> on the eleventh of <hi>December,</hi> which is our ſhorteſt; and their ſhorteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>St. Barnabies, viz.</hi> the eleventh of <hi>June</hi> which is our longeſt, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The Towns of chiefeſt note and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in this Province are firſt <hi>Gopiapo,</hi> an old Town in the moſt Northerly parts of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, towards the Sea, where it hath a very commodious Haven belonging to it. 2. <hi>La Serena,</hi> a Town ſituate on the banks of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quimbo,</hi> a pleaſant River a little above its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux into the Sea, built by <hi>Baldivia,</hi> in the year 1544: The Countrie about it very rich in
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:170201:223"/>
Mines of Gold; and the Town it ſelf ſo well garriſon'd for fear of the Natives, that when the Engliſh, under Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> about four-ſcore years ſince, attempted the gaining of the place, they found hot ſervice of it, being ſtoutly reſiſted and beaten back again to their ſhips, by a ſalley of no leſs than three hundred good Horſe and two hundred Foot. 3. <hi>St. Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> the principall Town of the Province, a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Sea, and the ordinary reſidence of the Governor, lying on the banks of the River <hi>Tapocalma,</hi> in the thirty fourth degree of Southern latitude, fifteen leagues diſtant from the South-Sea, at which it hath a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious and much frequented Haven, which they call <hi>Valparayſo,</hi> and where the Engliſh met with better fortune, as hath been ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the report of Sir <hi>Francis Drakes</hi> voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. 4. <hi>La Conception,</hi> a ſtrong Town, ſeated on the Bay called <hi>Penco,</hi> threeſcore or ſeventy leagues diſtant from <hi>St. Jago</hi> towards the South, a place not a little fortified both by Nature and Art, having the Bay and a certain ridge of high Mountains begirting it almoſt round about; and where it is otherwiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible, a Caſtle and certain Bulwarks with Ordinance, beſides a Garriſon of five hundred Souldiers at leaſt continually in it: and all
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:170201:223"/>
little enough to defend it againſt the <hi>Arau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes,</hi> their deadly Enemies, who live therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, and are ever and anon making incurſions almoſt up to the walls of it. Over againſt the place, in <hi>Mare del Zur,</hi> but very neer the ſhore, there lyeth a certain Iſland called <hi>St. Maries,</hi> exceedingly plentifull in Swine and all ſorts of Poultry, which the Garriſon of <hi>La Conception</hi> make good uſe of. 5. <hi>Los Confines:</hi> this is a Frontier Town, built by the aforeſaid <hi>Baldivia,</hi> for defence of the rich Mines of gold at <hi>Ongol,</hi> a place neer adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 6. <hi>La Imperiale,</hi> another ſtrong Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this place on the banks of the River <hi>Cauten,</hi> neer to which that great battel was fought, where <hi>Baldivia,</hi> with divers other Spaniards, was taken priſoner, who were no otherwiſe overcome, but by being overwearied with killing of their Enemies, and by that means not able to make their retreat. 7. <hi>Villa rica,</hi> another Colonie of the Spaniards in theſe parts, ſixteen leagues diſtant from <hi>Imperiale,</hi> and twenty five from the Sea. 8. <hi>Baldivia,</hi> ſo named from the Commander himſelf <hi>Pedro Baldivia,</hi> who built it in the Valley of <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dallanquen,</hi> two or three leagues diſtant from the Sea, where it hath a good and capacious Port; but neerer to it the beſt Mines of <hi>Peru,</hi>
                        <pb n="428" facs="tcp:170201:224"/>
ſo rich, that 'tis ſaid, they yeelded <hi>Baldivia</hi> every day, ſo long as he could enjoy them, twenty five thouſand Crowns for every man that wrought in them. 9. <hi>Oſorno,</hi> a Town ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Bay of <hi>Chilve</hi> in a barren Soile out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, but otherwiſe neither leſs rich, nor leſs populous than <hi>Baldivia</hi> it ſelf. Theſe three towns, <hi>viz. Baldivia, Imperiale,</hi> and <hi>Oſorno</hi> were in the years 1596, 1599, 1604, ſurprized by the <hi>Araucanes,</hi> and other ſava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges confederate with them, ſack'd and burnt; and though the Spaniards be ſaid to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and garriſond ſome of them with freſh Souldiers, yet how long they were able to hold them, or whether they be Maſters of them at this day I cannot ſay. There is likewiſe 10 <hi>Caſtro</hi> the moſt Southerly Town of the whole Province; built in a certain Iſland within the Bay of <hi>Chilve;</hi> and laſtly towards <hi>Paraguay</hi> and <hi>Rio de la Plata</hi> there are the Towns <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doza,</hi> and <hi>St. Juan de la Frontera;</hi> but they lye on the other ſide of the <hi>Andes,</hi> fourty leagues diſtant from any of theſe we ſpeak of, and perhaps more, and not above one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> and the Atlantick Ocean.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Magellanica,</hi> the other part of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince is bounded Northward with <hi>Chile</hi> above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:170201:224"/>
and ſome parts of the Countries <hi>de la Plata;</hi> on the South with the narrow-Sea called <hi>Magellans Streits,</hi> having <hi>Mare del Zur</hi> on the Weſt; and on the Eaſt the Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Ocean. It contains in length, from the borders of <hi>Chile</hi> to the mouth of the Streits, about one hundred leagues; and in breadth, <hi>viz.</hi> from the North to the South Sea, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more, <hi>viz.</hi> towards <hi>Chile</hi> and the North-weſt parts of it; for towards the South and South-weſt it ſtreightens ſtill more and more; inſomuch, that they which reſemble the Southern part of <hi>America</hi> to the form of a Pyramis reverſed, makes this part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie to be the ſpire or top of the Pyramis. It beareth the name of <hi>Ferdinand Magellan,</hi> a Portugheſe, who firſt diſcovered that narrow Sea, ſo famouſly known by the name of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellans Streits,</hi> upon which it lyeth. It is a large Countrie and ſuppoſed not to be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther barren of Metals; but as yet no great diſcoverie hath been made of it: partly by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the exceſſive cold to which 'tis thought to be ſubject: and partly perhaps by reaſon of the difficulty of the enterprize, it being ſo far remote, and very hardly paſſable in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by reaſon of the huge mountains the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> which barre it, as it were, againſt all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers:
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:170201:225"/>
but chiefly by reaſon of the ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and untameableneſs of the <hi>Araucanes</hi> and other Natives of <hi>Chile,</hi> through whoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie the march lyeth, and who muſt firſt be conquered. So that very little can be ſaid more of this Countrie, than only to name the Ports and places upon the Sea coaſts, at which the Spaniards, and likewiſe ſome other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at ſeveral times have touched: the chief whereof upon the South-Sea are firſt <hi>Cabo de las Iſlas,</hi> a Promontorie or Foreland twenty ſix leagues diſtant from that of <hi>St. Felix</hi> on the confines of <hi>Chile.</hi> 2. <hi>Puerto de San. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phano,</hi> fiftie leagues from that, towards the South. 3. <hi>La Valle de Nueſtra Sennora,</hi> or <hi>our Ladies Dale,</hi> a large and ſecure Bay, eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen leagues Southward of <hi>St. Stephens.</hi> 4. <hi>La Punta Delgada</hi> 5. <hi>Puerto de los Reyes.</hi> 6. <hi>Ancona Sin Salida:</hi> All of them South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward towards the Streits. Then is there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at the opening of the Streits <hi>Cabo de la Vittoria, Cabo Deſſeado,</hi> and ſome others. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the North-Sea, and up towards <hi>Rio de la Plata,</hi> the chief places obſerved are firſt <hi>Rio de la Crux,</hi> and the Cape which they call <hi>de las Rameras,</hi> about thirty leagues diſtant from the Streits mouth. 2. The Bay of <hi>St. Julian,</hi> fourty leagues Northward of that. 3. <hi>El
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:170201:225"/>
Puerto Deſſeado.</hi> 4. <hi>Puerto de los Leones.</hi> 5. The Bay of <hi>Anegada:</hi> All of them good and capacious Havens for the ſecurity of ſhipping upon theſe coaſts, and lying at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of thirty or fourty leagues one from another, up towards <hi>Rio de la Plata,</hi> and the Countrie of <hi>Paraguay,</hi> of which we are next to ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>the Streits</hi> themſelves, ſo much ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, and likewiſe ſo neceſſary to be known by thoſe who frequent theſe parts of the World, they are a narrow Sea or Frith, by which the Atlantick Ocean, or rather ſome parts of it, doth fall into <hi>Mare del Zur,</hi> or the South Sea. The paſſage is long, running, as 'tis commonly ſuppoſed, will nigh one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred leagues together, almoſt in a parallel line, or in the ſame degree of latitude from one end to the other: and likewiſe extremely difficult, by reaſon of the many windings and turnings of the Sea, which force them to be ever and anon altering of their courſe; and a Mountainous high Countrie on both ſides of it, from whence it is almoſt continually beaten with ſtorms, both dangerous and terrible, They were firſt diſcovered by <hi>Ferdinand Magellan,</hi> by Nation a Portugheſe, but in the ſervice of the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> and by him named <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellanes
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:170201:226"/>
Streits:</hi> who, although himſelf lived not to return into <hi>Spain,</hi> being ſlain in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the <hi>Moluccae</hi> Iſlands, yet his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions did, in the ſhip called <hi>Vittoria;</hi> from whence the Cape <hi>de la Vittoria</hi> aboveſaid took its name. They lye at the mouth or entrance of them by the Atlantick Ocean, in the fifty two degrees of Southern latitude, and have not above fifty three and ſome minutes at their <hi>Exit,</hi> or opening into the South-Sea. There is likewiſe ſince this, and of but late times, <hi>viz.</hi> about the year 1615 another <hi>Streit</hi> diſcovered, by the Dutch, and called from the Diſcoverer <hi>Fretum,</hi> or the <hi>Streits of le Maire,</hi> four or five degrees more to the Southward than thoſe of <hi>Magellan,</hi> and ſuppoſed to be a much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier and ſafer paſſage. The intention was, by the diſcovery of theſe <hi>Streights,</hi> to have found a ſhorter way to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and the Kingdoms of <hi>Cathay</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> than that which was then only uſed, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Cape <hi>de Buena Speranza,</hi> and the Coaſt of <hi>Africk:</hi> and ſo they doe; but by reaſon of the great difficultie and uncertaintie of the paſſage, I ſuppoſe neither the one nor the other is much frequented: the Spaniards for the moſt part ſerving themſelves of their American Ports upon the South-Sea, from whence they make

                        <p>Of the American Iſlands.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. VVE have ſpoken hitherto only of the Continent of <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> and thoſe Iſlands, which lye ſo neer the Continent, that they are commonly reckoned as part of it, and appertaining to the reſpective Provinces againſt which they lie. It remains now, (not to leave any thing conſiderable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd at leaſt) that we take a veiw of ſome other Iſlands <hi>viz.</hi> that lie further off and ſeem not to have any other relation to <hi>America,</hi> but only that of obedience and ſubjection to the Spaniards government, who are Lords of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi> and have reduced at leaſt the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall and chief of thoſe Iſlands, long ſince un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their power. They lye either in the South or the North Sea. Thoſe in the South, or <hi>Mare del Zur</hi> are chiefly two, <hi>viz. Los Ladrones,</hi> and the Iſlands <hi>Fernandinae. Los Ladrones,</hi> in Engliſh, the Iſlands of Theeves, lye as it were
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:170201:243"/>
in the midle way betwixt the Main-land of <hi>America</hi> and the <hi>Philippine Iſlands,</hi> but ſome hundred of leagues diſtant from either, in the fourth degree of Northern latitude. So na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by <hi>Ferdinand Magellan,</hi> from the pilfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring diſpoſition he obſerved in the Natives, when he ſailed that way for the <hi>Moluccae</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlands. They were a nimble and active ſort of People, yet light-fingerd, it ſhould ſeem, and going for the moſt part naked, tall of ſtature, excellent Swimmers and Divers, and have not much more to be ſpoken in their Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. The <hi>Fernandinae</hi> are only two Iſlands of no great bigneſs lying over againſt the coaſt of <hi>Chile,</hi> in the three and thirtieth degree of Southern latitude, and about one hundred leagues, or three hundred Engliſh miles from the Continent: yet well ſtored with ſome leſſer ſort of Cattel, as Goats, &amp;c. good plenty likewiſe of Veniſon in the Woods, and of Fiſh upon the Coaſts: for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, though lying at ſome diſtance, yet are they not a little frequented by the Spaniards of <hi>Peru;</hi> who finde many good Harbours and roads for ſhipping belonging to, and about theſe Iſlands.</p>
                     <p>But the chief, <hi>viz.</hi> of the American Iſlands
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:170201:244"/>
aboveſaid, are thoſe which lye in the Atlantick or North-Sea, on the Eaſt ſide, and as it were in the way to the Continent of <hi>America;</hi> which are as follow, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The <hi>Caribes.</hi> 2. <hi>Port-rico.</hi> 3. <hi>Hiſpaniola.</hi> 4. <hi>Cuba,</hi> and 5. <hi>Jamaica.</hi>

                        <p n="1">1. THe <hi>Caribee</hi>-Iſlands (as the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh commonly call them) are a row or ridge, as it were of leſſer Iſlands, which extend themſelves, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in faſhion of a Bow, from the Coaſt of <hi>Paria,</hi> as far as <hi>St. John de Port-rico:</hi> The name ſignifies as much as the Iſlands of Canni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals, or <hi>Man-Eaters;</hi> and ſo the Natives ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally were, before they were either deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or reduced to better manners by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards. There are many of them, but the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall and thoſe which ſeem moſt worthy of notice are, 1. <hi>Granada:</hi> This lyeth in form of a Croiſſant or half-Moon, upon the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of <hi>Paria, viz.</hi> that part of it which is called <hi>Cuniana;</hi> having a reaſonable good
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:170201:244"/>
Haven, and a Soil not altogether unfruitfull, but much over-ſhaded with Woods, and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto but little inhabited. 2. <hi>St. Vincent,</hi> ſix or ſeven leagues Northward of <hi>Granada,</hi> but from any part of the Continent ten at leaſt: a very fruitfull Iſland, yeelding aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Sugar-Canes that grow naturally without any Art or help of Husbandry; well watered with Rivers, and affording many convenient Bays and ſafe roads for ſhipping. It lyeth in a circular form, and is thought to contain about eight or ten leagues in compaſs; Inhabited by a People not over much induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, nor ſollicitous for ought but what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the belly. 3. <hi>Dominica,</hi> an Iſland of twelve leagues in length, very fruitfull of a good ſort of Tobacco, which the Europeans have of the Natives chiefly in exchange of Knives, ſome Hatchets, and other Inſtruments of Iron, which they value much. It hath on the Weſt ſide of it a convenient Harbour for ſhips; but the People being ſaid to continue Cannibals, and exceedingly barbarous, even to this preſent, no Nations as yet, have attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to inhabit among them. 4. <hi>La Deſſeada,</hi> a ſmall Iſland, but of great uſe to the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, who alwaies touch at it both coming and
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:170201:245"/>
going. 5. <hi>Guadalupe,</hi> another ſmall Iſland, which they likewiſe take in their way continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to and from <hi>America:</hi> it ſerves them chiefly for freſh water, and lyeth eight or ten leagues Weſtward of <hi>Deſſeada.</hi> 6. <hi>Antego,</hi> as the Engliſh corruptly call it, rather <hi>Antiqua,</hi> is an Iſland of about ſeven leagues in length, and almoſt as much in breadth, lying to the North-Eaſt of <hi>Guadalupe,</hi> where the Engliſh of late years are ſaid to have planted a Colony, but wherein their Trade lyeth, doth not ſo well appear. 7. <hi>St. Chriſtophers:</hi> This lyeth on the North-weſt of <hi>Guadalupe;</hi> where the Engliſh and French (both of them) having planted their ſeveral Colonies, were, not many years ſince, outed by the Spainyards, yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted quietly to paſs to their other Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The chief Commoditie which the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie yeeldeth is Tobacco; and in the Eaſterly parts of it ſome Salt. 8. <hi>Barbados:</hi> This is an Iſland at the North-Eaſt of <hi>St. Vincent,</hi> of an ovall form, and of the ſame bigneſs or extent with that of <hi>St. Vincent,</hi> that is, containing in the compaſs of the whole a matter of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or twenty miles. It lyeth the moſt Eaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of all the reſt of theſe Iſlands; of a Soil very luſty and good, eſpecially for ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:170201:245"/>
as are proper for it. On the Eaſt ſide it hath many Angles and Points ſhooting out into the Sea, which conſequently make many Bays upon the Coaſt of it; but, by reaſon of certain quick-ſands which lye before them, not much uſed or frequented by ſhips. On the South ſide it hath a large and convenient Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, capable of the talleſt ſhips, and well fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented. It is counted now one of the beſt Colonies of the Engliſh, but ſaid to have been heretofore not a little at the mercy of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard Their chief Trade is Tobacco, and a kinde of courſe Sugar, which we call <hi>Barbados-Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> and will not keep long; not that the Countrie is unapt for better, but, as 'tis rather ſuppoſed, becauſe the Planters want either skill, or ſtock, to improve things to the beſt. The Countrie is ſomewhat hot, and it behoves an Engliſh man to be very temperate and wary, when he goes firſt thither. 9. <hi>Sta. Crux,</hi> called by the Natives anciently <hi>Ayay,</hi> fifteen leagues diſtant from <hi>Port-rico</hi> to the South-Eaſt, woody and Mountainous, having on the Weſt ſide of it a convenient Harbour for ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They ſpeak of a certain Fruit of this Countrie not unlike to a green Apple; which if a Man eat, it cauſeth ſuch an inflammation
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:170201:246"/>
and ſwelling of his tongue, that for twenty four hours ſpace at leaſt, he looſeth the uſe of it quite; but afterwards it aſſwageth of it ſelf without further hurt: And alſo of certain Fen-waters, with which, if a Man chance to waſh his face before noon, it likewiſe ſwells ſo much preſently, that his eyes will be cloſed up; but in the afternoon no ſuch matter; which I mention, becauſe they ſay there is a Colony of Engliſh ſetled there of late years. There be many other of theſe <hi>Caribee</hi> Iſlands beſide, as namely <hi>Anguilla, Barbada, St. Bartholmews, Las Nieves, St. Lucies, St. Martins, Montſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>errat, &amp;c.</hi> but of ſo little conſideration, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to our Nation, that it would ſeem but tedious to mention them further.</p>

The Paſtures no leſs abounding with Cattell of all ſorts, eſpecially of European breed; the Rivers and coaſts of the Sea with good Fiſh: no ſcarſity of Fowl whether wild or tame; good Mines of Braſs and Iron ſtill found, with ſome Gold in the Rivers, eſpecially thoſe which fall into the Bay <hi>Pagua</hi> or the
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:170201:250"/>
ſouth-ſide of the Iſland. The Woods, where the Country is mountainous and rocky as in ſome parts it is, well repleniſhed with Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and many odoriferous trees beſide, from which they gather a certain Roſin, or Gumme, not leſs precious and uſefull than the <hi>Storax,</hi> or ſweet Gumme ſo called, of which the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boriſts ſpeak ſo much. In a word the only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience which the Spaniards found in it, was from Serpents, which the Natives out of an old ſuperſtition among them, had preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo long, they came to bee grieviouſly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed by them at laſt; and when they would have deſtroyed them, could not; what remedy the Spaniards have ſince provided againſt them, appeares not. The River <hi>Caute,</hi> which is one of the chiefeſt Rivers of the Iſland, is ſtill ſaid to be much haunted with Crocodiles; that are very dangerous to ſtrangers unacquainted with the Country, and to any that reſt or ſleep neer the banks of the River.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Towns and places of chief impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance belonging to this Iſland are, 1. <hi>St. Jago,</hi> ſeated at the bottom of a large and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Bay on the South-ſide of the Iſland, two or three leagues diſtant from the Sea, and counted the chiefeſt Port on that ſide. It is a Biſhops ſea, and once a very populous and rich
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:170201:251"/>
place of trade, but at preſent not a little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, only for want of Inhabitants, who are advanced more up into the Continent, having left the Iſlands behinde them more than half empty. Neer unto this place, <hi>viz.</hi> about three or four leagues diſtance, are thoſe famous Mountains, which the Spaniards call <hi>Sierras de Cobre,</hi> or the <hi>Braſs Mountains,</hi> from the aboundance of that Metal which the Mines in them doe ſtill afford, 2. <hi>Baracao,</hi> thirty leagues Eaſtward of <hi>St. Jago</hi> toward the Sea. 3. <hi>Bayamo,</hi> or <hi>St. Salvador,</hi> ſeated more within land in a rich and pleaſant part of the Iſland, but not ſo commodious for trade. 4. <hi>Puerto del Principe</hi> on the North ſide of the Iſland fourty leagues diſtant from <hi>St. Jago,</hi> neer to which, ſaith <hi>Laet,</hi> there is a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which ſendeth forth a liquor of a Bituminous ſubſtance, and black as Pitch, very good and much uſed in thoſe parts for the calking of Ships, and gathered in great abundance upon the Sea, into which it falleth, and is ſometimes digged alſo, as out of a Mine. 6. <hi>La Trinidad</hi> nine or ten leagues Eaſtward of the Bay of <hi>Xagua.</hi> Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 6. <hi>Havana,</hi> the moſt known and beſt traded Port abſolutely of all theſe parts, and and perhaps of the whole Continent, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:170201:251"/>
at the moſt northerly point of the Iſland towards <hi>Cape Florida;</hi> a place natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſtrong, and ſo well fortified by Art, that it is held impregnable. The entrance whereof is defended on each ſide with a ſtrong Caſtle, and a ſtronger than either built right oppoſite to the Mouth of the Haven; and all of them ſo commodiouſly and advantageouſly ſituated for the defence and aſſiſtance of each other, (as 'tis ſaid) nothing can be deviſed better. Cloſe to one of them there is erected a watch-Tower, of ſuch height, that from the top of it, they eaſily deſcry whatſoever Ships move upon thoſe Seas, and give notice of them to the Guards; being thereby a very great aſſurance not only to the Inhabitants of this place and Iſland, but alſo to the whole Bay of <hi>Mexico.</hi> And is therefore the ordinary Seat of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and the generall Rendezvous of the Spaniſh Ships, when they goe home for <hi>Spain,</hi> meeting heer from all parts of the Gulf, and tarrying one for another till all be come in, and from thence ſetting ſail for <hi>Spain,</hi> through the <hi>Sreits of Bahama,</hi> and by ſome of the <hi>Leu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayae</hi> Iſlands above mentioned. It is likewiſe a very ſtrong Garriſon; it being ſaid, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> allowes pay for no leſs number

than 1000. Souldiers only for this place.</p>

                           <hi>Jamaica</hi> is ſomewhat a leſſer Iſland, lying Southward of <hi>Cuba,</hi> and to the Weſt of <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaniola,</hi> almoſt at an equall diſtance, <hi>viz</hi> twenty leagues from them both. They reckon it to be in length about fifty leagues or more in breadth twenty, and to contain in the whole about one hundred and fifty, of a rich and fertil Soil, and in nothing leſs provided for the neceſſities of mans life, than either <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaniola</hi> or <hi>Cuba;</hi> well ſtock'd with Cattel, and as plentifully ſtored with Fruits of all ſorts, yeelding abundance of Cotton-wooll, more than either of the other Iſlands: only it wanteth the conveniency of ſome good Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and Ports, which it hath but few; and the Sea round about it ſo ſhelvy, and full of Rocks and broken Iſlands, that the coaſt of it is held to be not a little dangerous: and therefore as little frequented by Merchants or others. There being at preſent three only ſmall Towns inhabited in the whole Iſland, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Sevilla,</hi> or <hi>New-Sevill,</hi> in the North parts of the Iſland. 2. <hi>Melilla</hi> ten leagues diſtant from <hi>Sevill</hi> towards the Eaſt.
